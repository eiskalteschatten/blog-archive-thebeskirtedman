Danish skirt-wearer and [TEDx speaker](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/in-the-media/ted-talk-men-in-skirts/) Dylan Cawthorne is organizing an event this year in Odense, Denmark for anyone who is interested in non-judgemental fashion freedom. Anyone is welcome, no matter how (non-)conformist your wardrobe is. Just bring an open mind!

He bills the event as basically “a bunch of people hanging out at the harbor” which sounds like a lot of fun. It also took place last year where he had the chance to interview [Markus Muth](https://modemuth.de/). Photos from last year’s event can be found on Dylan’s website, [Men in Skirts](https://www.meninskirts.dk/).

The event takes place on **August 19, 2023** between **5:00-7:00 pm (17:00-19:00)** in **Odense, Denmark**.

You can find more information about the event on these websites:

I am hoping to attend, but will have to see if I have the time.

Dylan has also helpfully prepared a downloadable post for the event:
