This is a wonderful post from a mainstream parenting publication from a mother who goes through the ordeal of trying to find a dress for her young son. She shares her thoughts and difficulties in finding one for him “from the boys’ section”.

It’s an interesting reflection of how children are still entirely ignorant of the norms imposed upon people by society. They want what they want and will wear whatever feels good to them personally without a care in the world about what other people think. As adults, we should absolutely take inspiration from them.

Many clothing companies make lots of things for non-girly girls, but very little for boys who want to sparkle and feel their best.
