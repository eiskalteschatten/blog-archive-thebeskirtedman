I mentioned [in a previous post](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/in-public/going-for-a-walk-every-day-in-a-skirt/) that my goal this summer is to take a walk every day in a skirt. It’s been a while since I wrote about my idea, so I thought I would post an update to let you know how it’s going.

I can say right away that I haven’t achieved the goal by any stretch of the imagination. I get wrapped up in work in the morning, then am busy with my son in the afternoon which means I just don’t get out as much as I would like to. The weather has also not been great. Admittedly, those are more excuses than anything else…

That isn’t to say that I haven’t taken walks in skirts though. I went out to eat with my family last night wearing my black skirt from Engelbert-Strauss and we walked to the restaurant. I’ve also written about my experience [going for a walk with a guest we had](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/personal-experiences/two-days-two-skirts-and-two-visitors/).

Even if I haven’t achieved my goal of going for a walk in a skirt every day, I have been wearing skirts on family outings such as going out to eat. While they aren’t always walks, I’m still achieving the goal of getting out in public more frequently in a skirt and building up my confidence that way.

When the weather gets nicer, I am planning on taking my son to the playground more often and will, of course, be beskirted for that. That will involve a walk as well as potentially interacting with other parents or kids. I would say it will be interesting to see what reactions I get, but I probably won’t get any at all.

By going out more frequently, I am also finally finding the styles I feel most comfortable in. You can get a general feel for them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thebeskirtedman/). At the beginning of my beskirted journey, I experimented with a number of different types of skirts, dresses, tights, heels, etc. Most were in the direction of the very feminine/femboy look, but that was more of a phase. My style has settled down to mostly pencil skirts (denim or cloth) as well as a few knee-length a-line skirts.

But I digress.

There isn’t really an excuse as to why I haven’t gotten out for walks more often other than laziness. I haven’t gone either in skirts or jeans. Hopefully, when the weather improves, I’ll be more motivated. It’s hard to find the motivation when it’s gray and raining all the time.

*Do you go for regular walks? If so, do you wear a skirt? If not, what are your favorite excuses?*

Postscript: The skirt in the AI-generated image above is actually very similar to a dark gray denim skirt I frequently wear. I didn’t specifically ask AI to generate that particular one, but I was certainly thrilled that it came up with it on its own.
