Summer break is coming to an end. My son’s daycare has been closed for the past four weeks and so there has been ample opportunity for family time. He has gotten to enjoy all sorts of summer activities such as playgrounds, lakes and pools for the very first time in his life. Last summer he was still an infant and obviously couldn’t partake in any of those activities yet.

That said, it is also the reason why I haven’t had a lot of time for blogging. In fact, I haven’t had a lot of time for anything other than family-related activities. I’ve certainly enjoyed it, but am also looking forward to having some more time to write and pursue my other hobbies.

Some of you might be wondering what all of this has to do with skirts. Well, this summer, I have worn skirts out in public more than any other time in my life. I’ve worn them to the grocery store, to the playground, to the lake, when out for drives and walks, when visiting my mother-in-law, on the train, to the optometrist, etc.

Essentially, I’ve worn them practically everywhere I’ve gone. Occasionally, I’ve fallen back on my [“safety blanket skirts”](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/skirts-and-dresses/my-safety-blanket-skirts/) when I wasn’t feeling particularly confident or felt the need to be a bit more conservative in my mode of dressing (i.e. at my mother-in-law’s), but generally, I’ve enjoyed the freedom that wearing skirts has given me this summer.

It is incredibly liberating to finally just wear them out and not feel the need to hide inside the safety of my home while wearing them. That is what this summer has been about for me: *freedom*. I’ve worn skirts for several years now, but this is the first summer I’ve really embraced wearing them more or less full-time out in public.

Now that the beskirted cat is out of the bag, there is no going back. If we ever run into each other on the street or in the store, chances are I’ll be wearing a skirt.
