Since many people make New Year’s resolutions, our first poll of the new year asks whether you have made any skirt-related New Year’s resolutions. Ideas might be: wearing skirts more often, wearing them in public, or in front of people you haven’t dared to wear them in front of before.

Personally, I don’t tend to make New Year’s resolutions since I find them hard to keep, but if I were to make them, I would want to wear skirts more often in public. I do wear them out, but would like to continue working on building up my courage and making it even easier for myself.

Let us know the details in the comments below!
