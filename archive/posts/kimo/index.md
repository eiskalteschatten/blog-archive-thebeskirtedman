*Today, we welcome Kimo from Utah, USA to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Kimo

**Where are you from?**

I grew up in Hawaii, worked in various cities in Texas, and after a stint in California, settled here in Utah.

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Bra/panties, lingerie of all types, hosiery of all types, skirts and high heels with sneaker heels from Missy Rockz being my favorite.

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

About 10 years ago.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I came across a catalog from Homme Mystere that advertised men’s lingerie. I bought everything they offered from bras and panties to teddies, babydolls, camis and garters. All for men. I thought it was cool having lingerie made for men and that’s why I started getting them. (Unfortunately the couple running the company out of Australia decided to stop making any new lingerie and suspended operations in 2023.)

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

It makes me feel good about myself, keeps me warm in the winter time, and lets me express myself with bright colors.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

To me, it means adopting a way of expressing myself that makes me feel good about myself. It also provides me with an opportunity to explore other options that I may pursue that includes, but not limited to, crossdressing and/or MTF/transgender.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

I wear lingerie on a daily basis underneath other clothes and hosiery on a daily basis during the winter to keep warm.

For skirts and heels, I wear them at least once a week primarily on my weekend ventures to the grocery store. I also wear heels when I work at Kingsbury Hall at the University of Utah.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes I do.

If I worked in an office environment, I definitely would start out with heels and then work my way up to wearing nice professional looking skirts in the office. Unfortunately, I have to wear a uniform so that limits the frequency of time I can wear non-conforming clothes. I do try and wear skirts when I am at home and when I go out shopping around the neighborhood.

Generally places I go are generally safe places and I can feel okay to strut my stuff. The one place I do feel some uneasiness is riding the light rail trains around town. You just never know who’s riding the train and what might happen both good and bad.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Not at all. Most people don’t seem to care what kind of clothes I wear. They are worrying too much about themselves and don’t have any time to worry about me.

I did have a couple of interesting experiences that happened on the train, once when I was wearing my sneaker heels and once when I was wearing regular pumps.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

The experience has generally been positive. Obviously I get the most compliments from women who understand the fashions. Younger ladies are the most complimentary because they wish they could wear what I am wearing. Older women are probably jealous of me because they can no longer wear heels and I can. I also do get compliments from men too but not nearly as many as I get from women.

I have also gotten great compliments and feedback on my sneaker heels. They are hand designed and made by a lady in Germany so you don’t see them very much in the US. Even the head coach of the University of Utah women’s basketball team got excited about sneaker heels! When you look at them from above, they look like regular sneakers. I asked her if she would wear a pair of sneaker heels and she said yes, if I could get a pair. I lifted my shoe up to show her the heels and she got all excited. It just so happens that the heels I was wearing were also in the school colors of red and white! And yes she does wear heels on gameday!

I think the worst experience, if you can call it that, is the lame questions I get that are really silly to answer. I get asked: a) have you ever fallen while wearing heels? (No because I am careful about where I step.); and b) how can you wear those heels? a favorite from older women. (Because I can!) Women would never get asked those questions!!

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

I have a brother I live with and he knows. I also have a sister and I am not sure how she would react if she knew.

I also have a select group of friends who know and who have been very supportive

Some of my co-workers know but I only wear heels around them.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

Given the conservative nature of most people who live here in Utah, I do try and keep things low key. I’ve already had people come up to me and ask why I would want to endure menstrual cramps and periods just because I choose to wear high heels. They totally misunderstand that wearing heels and/or skirts does not automatically mean that I want to become a woman.

**What is your favorite style?**

I think I’m still trying to figure out that style but I love wearing skirts around both long and short.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Lingerie:

HommeMystere (No longer in business)

Skims.com

Heels:

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

One of the reasons why the wearing of women’s clothes is easy for me is that I am not a real big guy. I’ve always had high metabolism so I have never been able to gain weight or muscle mass. There are lots of times when I feel like I’m a man trapped in a women’s size body. Women’s clothes seem to fit on me with no problems. I also have a narrow foot so adapting to heels has been no real problem.
