To get the new series [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/) kicked off, I thought I would share my own profile first. I filled out the [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/kQfMkgAbkDCou4wx8) and this is the result.

**What is your name?**

Alex

**Where are you from?**

I am originally from the United States, but I now live in Germany.

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

I enjoy wearing skirts, dresses, tights and high heels.

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

I started wearing skirts secretly in college. I added heels to the mix several years later.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I started out of simple curiosity. I wanted to know what it felt like to wear a skirt since they are so different from pants. I ordered my first skater skirt online and have never looked back since.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

Skirts, dresses and heels have taken on an entirely different meaning for me since I first got started. I not only wear them now because they are comfortable but also because they symbolize my rebellion against toxic masculinity.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Over the years, I have come to realize how much of a negative impact toxic masculinity has had on my life and my gender non-conforming clothing represents my push back against it.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Practically every day, all day.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes, I do go in public in gender non-conforming clothes. I usually wear skirts and/or heeled boots. Even if I don’t wear a skirt, I often wear heeled boots with jeans. Since I work from home, I don’t go out every day, but I probably go out at least a couple of times a week. I go wherever I need to or want to.

I don’t wear a skirt or heels where it’s impractical: the gym, hiking (no heels), etc. I also wouldn’t wear them in places where I might be in physical danger such as the Deep South of the United States.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I find it difficult to work up the courage to step outside, but once I’m out in public, it becomes very easy and I have a lot of fun with it.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I’ve had a lot of good experiences, so it’s difficult to say what my best experience is, but I would say any of the compliments I’ve received from strangers would be among the best experiences.

As far the worst is concerned, that would be what [I recently posted about](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/personal-experiences/my-only-negative-experience-in-a-skirt-in-public/) when a man yelled loudly in a crowded train station that he found my skirt shitty.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes, they do and they support me fully.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

The only people I wouldn’t want to know about it are my arch-conservative relatives in the Deep South of the United States.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Absolutely. [She even writes about it](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/julias-perspective/)!

**What is your favorite style?**

I generally prefer a fairly “masculine” style with bold, solid colors, square cuts and shirts from the men’s department. That isn’t to say that I don’t like flowing skirts or floral patterns, but I just prefer solid colors.

The “masculine” style also applies to my choice of heels. I prefer boots with a block heel rather than pumps and stilettos.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Primarily online. A lot of online German clothing retailers are starting to offer skirts and heels “for men” and I can find the styles I like. It’s hard to find anything I like in brick-and-mortar stores regardless of whether it’s from the men’s or women’s department.

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I really enjoy writing about one of my favorite hobbies: wearing gender non-conforming clothing. The clothes themselves are not only fun, but wearing them out in public and breaking gender stereotypes is something I find extremely enjoyable.

I hope to inspire other men to do the same and show them that it really isn’t that scary. There are certainly a lot more of us out there than you would think.
