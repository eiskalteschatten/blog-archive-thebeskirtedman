*Today, we welcome Rex from the UK to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Rex

**Where are you from?**

UK

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

All! Skirts, dresses, hosiery, underwear, shoes and boots.

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Initially as a young teenager with occasional experimentation with what was available at home but much later, after divorce and with acceptance / support from female partners, rapid acceleration in middle age.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

How: see above. Why: I cannot explain my motivations. At first there was some sexual thrill, and inquistiveness, but that barely registers now.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

It provides mental comfort and an outlet for my long-standing non-conformity in many aspects of life. Sometimes it’s what gets me out of bed in the morning!

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

They are a central part to my life.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Virtually every day.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I have made a few public excursions in gender non-conforming clothes, but mostly when accompanied by my partner and in busy public places where I would not be recognised eg at festivals and in busy shops.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Yes

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Best: wearing a skirt continuously for two days at a music festival. Worst: Nothing serious apart from anxiety when setting off skirted to walk for several miles. I was OK once I was away from my local neighbourhood.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Family: No. Partner: Yes

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

In principle I would want everyone to know about it, but in practice I would be very cautious telling many people owing to anxiety / lack of confidence / embarrassment / fear of rejection.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Yes – and she even lets me wear her clothes. She objects in only two circumstances: if I wear something she considers to be more suitable for an elderly aunt; and she also forbids me to wear a bra in her presence because it is “unnecessary’.

**What is your favorite style?**

I have no set style. I will try most things, from adding a skirt to an otherwise “masculine”outfit, to an evening dress with stiletto heels.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Chain stores and occasionally online.
