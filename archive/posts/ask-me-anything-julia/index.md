As some of you already know, my wife, Julia, has written [a number of posts](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/julias-perspective/) where she discusses her experiences being married to a man who wears skirts, heels, and other gender-non-conforming clothes. Her posts have proven popular as they provide a different perspective on the topic and we’ve even heard from some men who say they have helped their wives accept their love of skirts.

That being said, we have also noticed there are a number of questions that have arisen from both men and their wives, but we haven’t found the best format to answer them. So we decided to kick off an “ask me anything” for Julia.

So if there are any questions you would like to ask Julia, please let us know in the comments below or via the [contact page](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/contact/)! Feel free to ask anything and Julia will respond in a post or series of posts depending on how detailed her answer is.

We aren’t going to place a time limit on this, so even if you’re reading this post a long time after publication, feel free to ask anyway!

We are looking forward to hearing from you!
