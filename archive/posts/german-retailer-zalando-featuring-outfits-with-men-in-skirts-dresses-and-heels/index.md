One of my favorite online retailers for clothes in Germany has started featuring curated collections with men in skirts, dresses and heels. They’ve been promoting genderless fashion for a few months now and have become my go-to source for heeled boots since they offer many of them up to size 45 (US 12). Most of skirts are also from them.

Below is the link to their collections for men. Most still have typical men’s clothing, but it doesn’t take long to find the one or the other in a skirt or dress.
