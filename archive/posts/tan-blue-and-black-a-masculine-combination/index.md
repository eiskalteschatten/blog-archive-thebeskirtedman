I’m kicking off the new “[Outfits](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/outfits/)” series with one of my favorites that I frequently wear when the weather is cool or cold. As the title mentions, it features three colors that fit my body type well: tan, blue and black.

In this particular outfit, I have combined a long-sleeved, tan, button-down shirt from the men’s department with my blue skirt from Engelbert-Strauss. Sometimes I exchange this skirt for a blue denim skirt or even my blue A-line skirt from Anna Field.

If the weather is cooler, these are paired with black tights or leggings and my tan, high-heeled boots from Anna Fields. Depending on the temperature, I might add a black cardigan, sweater or hoodie depending on how cold it is and how casual I want to be. I particularly like the black cardigan as featured in the photo below because it stays open allowing you to see the tan shirt underneath. It also adds a nice “feminine” touch to an overall pretty masculine outfit.

I call this outfit “masculine” because it features traits that are typically seen in the men’s department such as bold, solid colors and straight, harsh lines. In my duology of posts, “[How To Dress Masculinely in a Skirt](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/skirts-and-dresses/how-to-dress-masculinely-in-a-skirt-part-1/)“, I discuss what makes an outfit more “masculine” in the eyes of most observers.

The outfit as shown below consists of the following components:

-   A long-sleeved, tan shirt made from 100% cotton
-   [The blue skirt from Engelbert-Strauss](https://www.engelbert-strauss.de/en/womens-tabards-aprons/skirt-e-s-motion-ten-ladies-3161420-66256-1407.html?itemorigin=SEARCH)
