This video is a monologue about whether regular people can [queerbait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queerbaiting). The reason I am posting it is because there is a segment that addresses straight, cis-men who dress and/or act in a more feminine way and whether they queerbait.

I suspect this could be a controversial video. Let me know your opinions about down in the comments below!
