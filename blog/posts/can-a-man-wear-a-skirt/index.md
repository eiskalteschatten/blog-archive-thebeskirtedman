Yes, definitely!

I do agree with him, however, that skirts (and dresses) cut for a female body can look a little strange on a broader male body. That is the reason I generally only wear skirts rather that full dresses even though I love dresses.

It isn’t that men shouldn’t wear skirts and dresses, but rather that we need more that are cut for the male body.
