*Today, we welcome Darryl from England to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Darryl

**Where are you from?**

Stowmarket, England

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts & tights, skinny jeans with heeled boots. I have a few dresses, but I’ve not built up the courage to go out in them yet. I wear skirts and Vans at work nearly everyday.

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Lockdown. I know, this has become almost a cliché. But the freedom to express myself empowered me to be myself. So when I went back to the office, I did so in a jean skirt.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

Baz Lurhmann and Eleanor Roosevelt said, “Do something that scares you every day,” I feel a little scared every time I leave the house, but it’s also a very real buzz. I do it because it makes me happy.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

I don’t feel myself in trousers, quite simply that.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Happiness. I love the extra clothing choices, colour matching options and tailoring I can play with.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Everyday. Almost without exception.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I do. I would be miserable if I didn’t, I definitely get a euphoria from feeling comfortable in my clothes and skin.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I do, but I still do it. Dresses are my next challenge.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Best- I often get compliments from ladies at work about my skirt choices. Which is lovely. Worst- like you, at a train station: 20~ish chap said as loud as he could said, “You’re in a skirt!!”. All I could say as load as he was, “You’re correct” his mate just dragged him by the arm down the platform. I had palpitations all day after that.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

They do, I’ve been very public about it for the last two years. Even at family functions.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

If I ever had to change jobs, I worry about interviews and new people. But that’s not an issue right now.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

He does. Although, he can be vocal about preferring me to be manly. And that he hates me in a flowery skirt. He’s a bit older than me, it is all a bit new to him. He’s getting there

**What is your favorite style?**

T-shirt, denim skirt and tights. Sometimes with heeled boots or with Vans.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

M&S, Yours, Bonmarché and Amazon. My favourite bedding Bonmarché.

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I’m definitely trying to live by the rule clothes have no gender. But, I’m still fighting my own internal demons about what “others” think are acceptable.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**
