Todayâ€™s poll asks about a potential new feature for this website. It would interest me to know if you are satisfied with how commenting currently works on blog posts or if you would rather have more of a forum-style commenting system.

By that, I mean having a forum here similar in style to [Skirt Cafe](https://www.skirtcafe.org/forums/) but with the general look and feel of The Beskirted Man. A new thread would be created for each new post where commenting would take place instead of directly on the post itself.

*There used to be a poll here, but had to be removed for this Markdown file because it relied on a WordPress plugin.*
