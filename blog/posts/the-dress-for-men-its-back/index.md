This is an interesting article about men wearing dresses. It includes a little bit of history of men and dresses as well as a little bit about why men should wear dresses and which ones are best suited for them.

The only unfortunate thing is that the link at the bottom that says “Find your man dress” actually leads to the women’s section of their shop since, I assume, that is the only section where dresses are available.
