As [I mentioned in a post](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/general/does-anyone-work-in-a-tech-related-field-i-need-your-help/) that was published yesterday, I am looking for information about people who work in a computer science-related field and either don’t conform to gender norms or are trans.

There are a lot of them out there (including myself), so I thought I’d start a poll to see how many readers of this blog work in a computer science-related field.

*There used to be a poll here, but had to be removed for this Markdown file because it relied on a WordPress plugin.*
