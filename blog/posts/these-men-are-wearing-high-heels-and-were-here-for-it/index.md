This is an interesting article from Vice about men who are embracing wearing high heels and why they do so. It is similar to an article that [Vice posted about men in skirts](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/in-the-media/more-men-are-wearing-skirts-and-were-here-for-it/). Some of the heels range from more subtle (like Chelsea boots with a higher-than-average heel) while others are much more extravagant. As always, it’s great seeing men who are not afraid to break the gender stereotypes whether it’s in skirts, heels or any other typically gendered item of clothing!
