I have to admit that finding relevant articles to post about is getting harder and harder which is why I’ve been forced to skip some Fridays. That said, I ran into a couple of interesting articles to post last weekend and so here we are.

Earlier this week, I stumbled upon an article about the Paris Men’s Fashion Week that took place this past week. The article appeared on CNN’s homepage and asked the question: “Can midi skirts and bright colors appeal to men?” Obviously, it caught my attention. I took a screenshot of it for posterity:

The article is generally about the styles featured at the Paris Men’s Fashion Week, but does feature a couple of pictures of men in skirts and it briefly discusses them.

While this isn’t the first fashion show we’ve seen with men wearing skirts and also not the first article to talk about it, what makes it so interesting for me is that it was featured on the homepage of a large, mainstream news organization. That alone won’t change much, but at least the topic seems to be taking on more relevance in the mainstream media.

Midi skirts, sparkly jackets and vibrant colors featured on the men’s runway in Paris, offering a repeal to the quieter, functional dressing that has pervaded menswear in recent years.
