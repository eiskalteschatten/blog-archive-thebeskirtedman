**What is your name?**

Roger N

**Where are you from?**

Kent, UK

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

2009 which was a couple of years after I retired ( I retired at the age of 48)

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I had a large garden that was largely un-over looked and I enjoyed naked gardening. However the part of the garden by the back door was visible to the neighbors. So I originally wore just shorts in the summer and removed the shorts once I was out of view. However removing shorts whilst wearing gardening boots is difficult. So I then wore a sarong which was easy to remove. Having realised just how comfortable a skirt is , I started wearing them around the house. Then I progressed on to skirts and kilts for going out.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

Skirts are just more comfortable than trousers.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Given that in large part of the globe away from the wast Skirts and dresses for men is the norm and women are free to wear anything I think that Gender non-conforming clothing is mainly a society construct. Having said that there is clothing specifically designed/styled for the female form. – Such as Bras / Tops / dresses which do not fit a man without padding.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

I wear skirts all the time. I have no trousers/shorts in my wardrobe.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not?** **If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

As a full time skirt wearer I always wear skirts in public. I have traveled in the UK and Europe in skirts. For more formal occasions I will wear a kilt.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

It was a little uncomfortable when I started first started in 2009 but after a couple of years I just stopped thinking about it.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

The best side is the complements which can start conversations about skirt wearing. in the early days I did get a bit of abuse from youngsters, but that does not happen anymore. The biggest problem is the wind blowing my skirts up.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Every body knows I wear skirts as it is full time.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

No

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

My wife at the time I started wearing skirts was unhappy but it was a marriage on the rocks anyway and it ended a couple of years later. all my partners since then have been happy with the skirts.

**What is your favorite style?**

A line or wider as I like the freedom of movement. Mostly plain dark colours for everyday wear. Tartans for formal occasions and bright colours for social with friends.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

High street Shops ( few are happy to let me try them on) and online.
