I just wanted to make a quick post about the next couple of weeks. I will be largely absent from this blog and my social media channels as we are having company from the US. I’m looking forward to the visit, but will not be posting much due to a lack of time and content.

The visitors are family from the deep south of the US and, as I’ve written about before, I’ve largely kept my skirt-wearing from them for political reasons.

In any case, I will be back after they leave with a few more almost-finished posts I’ve been working on. See you all then!
