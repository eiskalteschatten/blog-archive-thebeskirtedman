*Today, we welcome Kevin from Belgium to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Kevin

**Where are you from?**

Belgium

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirt, tights, stockings (with and without garter belts) & high heels

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

At 13 or 14, I can’t remember exactly. It begun with tights

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I begun at about 13 to 14 years old because my older sister was wearing black tights that I thought to be really neat and very nice looking. I was a little bit green of envy because she had a great look and girls clothes were actually very much nicer than boy’s.

My parents violently pushed against my will of wearing gender non-conforming clothes during my teenage years. My father & step-mother were vehemently against that, calling me “a freak”, amongst other very “nice” words. The day I “got caught” wearing tights, I was screamed at during 7 hours. I can still remember pretty well.

Once I got my own place, I begun to wear clothes of the opposing gender and never stopped since.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

I feel nice in such clothes. I feel less as the “alpha male” that the society want me to be. I am more human and more in touch with the “soft”, gentle & caring part of myself.

I want to push my beliefs. The beliefs were anyone should be able to wear whatever they want without being labelled as deviant, or laughed at. I would like an open society where men and women would just be able to wear a skirt or a pant without any comments against them.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Freedom of wearing whatever I want, and to be whoever I want to. I also enjoy the design of those clothes : the lines and colours used are much more rich than standard “male” clothes. I enjoy the bright colours of tights and stockings, I like to mix the highly feminine look of a skirt with tights with a “serious” shirt

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

3 to 5 times a week

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I wear tights and stockings under pants, as my workplace as a very strict dress code. Recently, I wore a skirt in Louvain-la-Neuve, when I had to pick-up a new phone…it was a highly stressful 45 minutes experience, but it went really well.

Recently, I begun to wear skirt when going from the house to the car, riding to the workplace. Being the one who open the building, I never met anyone so early.

I would not go in Charleroi or in a lot of parts of Brussels, where people are known for being very narrow-minded.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Yes, I am not yet used to go out in skirt, even if I have been wearing tights & stockings under a pant for years.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Not yet a “worst” experience but one neutral and one good:

The neutral one : I went to Louvain-la-Neuve to pick up a new phone. I went through the whole city and the FNAC shop wearing my blue denim skirt & blue tights. No comment heard from anyone…it went smoothly.

A good/neutral one : I went to my best friend’s place to pick up some paperworks but only his wife, who is also a close friend of mine, was there. She offered me a coffee cup and, when I stepped into their house, I removed my shoes…and remembered that I was wearing green stockings without socks. So…she saw that I was wearing nylons.

She did not say anything, and was friendly as usual.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

My wife knows that I wear tights and stockings. She is not yet aware that I wear skirt and high heels…but I will talk about it to her.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

Yes. My co-workers. Some of them would be OK with the fact, I think but others would have a hard time to even just accept that I am around dressed with a skirt.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

So far, yes. But she is not yet aware of my want to wear a skirt.

**What is your favorite style?**

A mid-length, slotted, skirt with tights; or a denim skirt just above the knees, also with tights. And I am looking for shoes, but I think I will try some found on Zalando.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Mainly on-line, but sometimes in physical shops, especially for stockings.

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I am a regular guy. I love my wife, my kids, working on cars & rifles, hiking, running, astronomy & reading….like many, many people. But I also enjoy to mix clothes, no matter what “gender” is assigned to said clothes.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**

I created an instagram profile regarding my life : [https://www.instagram.com/tribulationsmaladroites/](https://www.instagram.com/tribulationsmaladroites/)
