When i was 4 or 5 my sisters used to let me wear their clothes then i realised it wasn’t the done thing unfortunately.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I just love the feeling of wearing skirts and dresses and leggings.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

When i work from home a couple of days a week i will wear leggings or a skirt.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not?** **If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**
