Winter is upon us here in the Northern Hemisphere and as such, it’s time to dig out the tights again. Unfortunately, I tend to dislike them as I much prefer the freedom of a skirt without anything bifurcated on underneath. That is largely due to the fact that I find them uncomfortable even if I do enjoy the way they look.

Since I know many of you love wearing tights and have a lot of experience with them, I thought it might be a great idea to start a discussion here where you can share any tips or tricks you use to make them comfortable.

To get things started, I’ll mention my primary issues with them: slipping down, pinching and pulling leg hair. Tights are infamous for sliding down and I have solved this problem by wearing a second pair of briefs with a good elastic waistband on the *outside* of the tights. This way, they don’t slide down at all even if things might feel a bit constricted down there.

As for the pinching and pulling leg hair, I haven’t found a good solution yet. I have shaved my legs in the past and that solves the latter issue, but it is not something I want to do all the time. As far as the pinching is concerned, I suspect that is just an issue with the fact that most tights aren’t made for the male anatomy and there isn’t much I can do about that.

So, with that said, what are your tips, tricks and advice for making tights comfortable? What problems do you have or have you had with tights and if you have solved them, how?
