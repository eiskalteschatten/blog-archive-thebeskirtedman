I have to admit that I am flabbergasted by how successful [Profile of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/) has been! When I first came up with the idea, I thought I might get a few submissions that trickle in slowly, but I received so many that there have been months’ worth of profiles.

It really just goes to show that there are so many men out there who enjoy the fashion freedom that comes with wearing gender-non-conforming clothes. Of course, the number of men who submitted their profiles is just a minuscule fraction of the actual number of men out there who enjoy it. Many are online and active on social media while others enjoy it entirely offline.

The Series Continues
--------------------

This post does not mean the end of the series, however! It just means I’ve run out of profile submissions to post.

On that note, if you haven’t submitted a profile yet and would like to, you can do so at any time by following the instructions below.

How to Participate
------------------

There are two ways to participate:

-   Fill out the questionnaire on [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/kQfMkgAbkDCou4wx8)
-   Download the questionnaire as a [Word document](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Questionnaire-for-Profiles-of-Beskirted-Men-1.0.docx), fill it out, and submit it as indicated in the document

I will review and publish every response I receive. All questions are optional and any questions not answered will simply be omitted from the final post. If you would like to be notified about when your profile will be published, please indicate that on the questionnaire and I will let you know.

If you would like to submit a picture to be posted with your profile, please email it to alex \[at\] the-beskirted-man.com and indicate the name you give me in the form so that I know which profile it belongs to.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments below or by [contacting me directly](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/contact/). I will try to answer every one of them and update this post to include any missing information accordingly.

If you need inspiration, you can see the profiles others have submitted [here](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/).

I’m looking forward to hearing from you!
