**What is your name?**

Jeffrey

**Where are you from?**

Pittsburgh PA

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts, tights and leggings

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Skirts about 2 years ago, tights and leggings 40 years plus

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I started wearing unitard and tights during the 80’s aerobics fitness days. I didn’t like always wearing shorts and sweatshirts. I taught and competed in aerobics. The standard outfit for women was a thong unitard over tights. I like how they outfit looked for aerobics but there was nothing for guys to wear for workouts. So I decided to wear something unisex for aerobics classes. I started wearing one piece bodysuit with a thong bottom over top. I wore thong unitard over bike shorts with legwarmers. I was the guy at the gym known for wearing wild aerobics workout outfits. I got a lot of female attention for showing off my physic since I was the only dude that dared to cross the gender outfit line.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

I’m now 66 years old and I feel time is to short to be placed in a gender conforming box. I’m just a straight, married man with 4 grown up kids and 8 grandkids. I just love wearing skirts and leggings instead of pants. I started about 2 years ago and I wish I had started many years sooner. I wear skirts not to be a drag queen like on Ru Paul’s drag race. Thats ok for the men that want to cross dress but it’s not how I roll. I just wanted to have different fashion options besides plain mens clothing.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

It allows me the freedom to expression of my true inner self that wants to show both genders.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Almost every day If I can get away with it

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes

Shopping, running errands, church, dates with my wife, work, yoga and being put and about. The only place I won’t we at a skirt is in front of my mother, she is 92 and not a big fan. I also wont wear a skirt to my mens bible study, love these guys but they are not very progressive on gender attitudes. But a few of the guys have seen me skirted on public places with no comment. I have worn a skirt in front of my adult daughter, but not in front of my sons. But they are aware the I wear skirts and kilts.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Not really but depends on the social situation.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

The best is when no one really cares or notices and when I get out if they blue random positive comments about my outfit.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

My 2 brothers and in-laws

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Yes

**What is your favorite style?**

Skirt with polo shirt or hoodie, t shirt. Casual

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Goodwill, salvation army and other thrift shops. Plus online sites

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I’m just a regular guy that loves wearing skirts or kilts instead of pants or shorts.
