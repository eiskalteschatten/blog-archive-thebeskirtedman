*Today, we welcome jcny from New York, USA to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

jcny

**Where are you from?**

rural northern New York State

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

lightweight satin & lace undies, skirts/dresses, tall socks and tights, some heels

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Been a long time! Undies first, then skirts some years ago, others since

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I love the feel of satin, so those undies/panties have long been my only preference. Skirts & dresses got started for comfort, after some kidney surgery – the high waist (or none, in some dresses) proved MUCH more comfortable, and surprisingly good-looking, too.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

It looks good, and it feels good.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

i have no socio-political motive, though my kids claim I like to be a bit outrageous just because. I argue otherwise, that I do what I do because it makes sense to me, and if that varies from the norm and is perceived as outrageous or shocking, that’s irrelevant to me. I just find my clothing choices to be less boring, better-looking, and WAY more comfortable (for the most part) than conventional men’s options – in most cases. Notably, there are tasks that require pants: like working on the roof or fixing cars; but I have found almost all activities, from hiking, to shopping, to gardening, to driving – all to be better in a skirt. I Like it.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Most days, unless the tasks at hand require otherwise for safety, cleanliness, or other special need.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes, all the time, to do whatever needs doing. Today to the grocery, the bank, the home center, and the post office; a rather typical run of errands.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

no.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I’m going to infer that this question means my best/worst experience where non-conforming clothes were an matter driving that best/worst quality (as almost all my days’ experiences are “in gender non-conforming clothes,” those clothes have usually little or no direct impact on the experience!). I guess a high point would be the day I was hiking along a rail trail and as I ended my walk at the car park; I was approached by a woman who had just arrived. She asked if she could speak with me and and ask a few questions. Sure. She wanted to know why I was wearing a skirt (it would have been an above-the-knee denim, with walking sandals and some ordinary shirt – it was a very nice day). I said, as I have here, because it’s comfy and cool and good-looking. She went through a range of optionals (gay, trans, etc.) and I said, no, just me. She asked about my marital status(long-term monogamous), and in the end was convinced I was pretty normal but unfettered by gendered clothing rules. She was then as complimentary as she had been curious at first. Finally, our conversation drifted into other areas, including her work and local events. etc. In short, we became friends, and I assign that outcome to the ice-breaker my clothing presented. Nice.

So far, not bad experiences – unless we count a wrinkled-up nose on my sister for one of my outfits.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes. As my son-in-law said when I asked if his mom would be OK with my style, “You be you.” And she didn’t mind at all either. The first time we met, she said, “if your wife is OK with it, it’s fine with me.”

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

no

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Yes, of course. And in fact, we enjoy colors and selecting together. She has a good eye and we both are complimentary and supportive of the other’s outfits

**What is your favorite style?**

Mine, of course! But I think you’re asking what I most enjoy wearing: a shirt with a chest pocket, tucked into a belted short skirt, with walking sandals. I cooler weather, adding over-the-thigh long socks, sometimes with closer leather shoes. Preferred colors are non-primary (peach, teal, etc. rather than red, blue, yellow). Matching-color leather items (belt and shoes). I like a crisp, neat look – as opposed to the untucked tee over baggy shorts or jeans that seems to be the male default.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

mostly online (see “where do you live?” – rural)

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I thoroughly enjoy your blog, Alex. I also maintain some direct correspondence with other skirted men around the world. It’s a thoughtful, engaging community.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**

None of my own. I do like to promote re-use of clothing (fast fashion waste is a terrible load on our planet), so let me recommend [Poshmark.com](http://poshmark.com) for skirts and dresses.
