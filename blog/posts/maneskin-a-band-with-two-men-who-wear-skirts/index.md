Every once in a while you run into men in skirts where you least expect it. In this case, I stumbled upon a video of the Italian band Måneskin playing live in concert while wearing skirts. Well, then men anyway. The female bassist wears pants. I can’t say I’m a huge fan of their music but the fact that they are wearing skirts on stage made me happy to see. We need more of this! The more men who wear a skirt visibly in public, the better!

The video below is just the first one I ran into. There are several others of them wearing skirts and just generally not caring about gender norms when it comes to their clothing choices.
