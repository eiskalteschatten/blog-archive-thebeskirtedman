*Today, we welcome Dylan who is originally from Alaska USA, but now lives in Denmark to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Dylan

**Where are you from?**

From Alaska, USA; living in Denmark

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Dresses, skirts, nail polish, jewellery, make-up, hair color

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Five year ago

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I started by exploring the idea through an art exhibition. I did this because I saw gender norms being restrictive and unfair.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

Fairness and fashion

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

They are a way to push back against stereotypes, and have fun looking unique at the same time

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

I usually wear at least one non-conforming element at all times. For example, I am very accustomed to having my nails painted and they are often colourful. I wear skirts and dresses less frequently, usually for events or special occasions

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes, I go to work, hang out with friends, go shopping, do volunteer work, etc. I usually don’t wear non-conforming clothing when I visit my family in the USA (Georgia). I typically don’t wear non-conforming clothes on a night out.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

It takes a fair amount of extra mental energy, because people are going to notice you, maybe judge you, or could react negatively to you.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I have had many positive experiences! At a yearly party at work (the university) I wore a fancy dress and got so many compliments, high fives, and flirts.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

No. I was concerned that my fashion could harm my career or have students or colleagues respect me less. Now, those around me are used to my unique style and values. And they seem to accept them.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

I am single now, but my precious partners were ok with it.

**What is your favorite style?**

Colourful, customised, and \*extra\*

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Second hand shops mostly, along with the “women’s” department at shops, and online

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

To me, fashion is a form of loving activism. With it, we might be able to make things for all kinds of people <3

Thanks for keeping the conversation about fashion and gender going!

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**

Yes!
