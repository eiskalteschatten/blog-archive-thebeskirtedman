A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a post about one of [my coworkers who enjoys dressing as a femboy](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/skirts-and-dresses/follow-up-a-femboy-at-work/). I used an AI-generated image that depicted a man in a stereotypical femboy costume featuring a maid’s dress and cat ears, which is one of my coworker’s favorite outfits.

In the comments, I received quite a bit of feedback about that AI-generated image and most of you weren’t excited about it or the AI-generated images I use in general.

I have resorted to AI-generated images to depict the topic I want to express with a post since there is a distinct lack of available stock images in this (still) fairly niche topic. Unsurprisingly, any pictures I find with skirts exclusively feature women.

So now the question: Should I change the way I use them? Or should I stop using them altogether Please let me know your thoughts in the comments below as any feedback would be incredibly helpful! Thank you!
