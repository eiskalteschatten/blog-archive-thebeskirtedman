I have largely been absent from the internet for the past three weeks because I have been down and out with the flu. It seems to be a particularly nasty strain and, while I’ve certainly gotten better, just doesn’t seem to want to go away entirely.

As such, I just haven’t had the energy to do much at all. I haven’t replied to comments, worked on any new posts, posted new pictures on Instagram or done much of anything. I’ve worn my warm maxi skirts because they make great built-in blankets, but I can’t be bothered with posting pictures right now. I will get back to it eventually though.

Thanks for the patience and understanding!
