I can’t say I have a whole lot to write about this week. I wore skirts, but took few pictures due to lack of time and inspiration. The only photos I took were of me wearing one of my favorite pleather skirts combined with a red long-sleeve shirt, black tights and pleather heeled boots. You can see them below.

There were exactly zero reactions to me wearing skirts this week which, as usual, is both pleasing and disappointing at the same time. It’s disappointing because I thoroughly enjoy talking to people about the subject, especially if they haven’t seen a man in a skirt before, but the good news is that it shows that no one actually cares very much about whether a man is wearing a skirt or jeans.

As far as the blog is concerned, I received another new [profile submission](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/) that I have yet to prepare. I apologize for the slow pace, but I will get to it soon. Submissions are always open if you are interested! For instructions on how to submit, see [the post I wrote about it](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/profiles-of-beskirted-men/profiles-of-beskirted-men/).

I’ve also been working on a couple of new posts about wearing skirts in certain situations such as at the beach or in the train. My hope is that, by sharing my experiences in various locations or situations, it will help other men see that there isn’t anything to fear.

In any case, I hope all of you had a great week and are having an even better weekend!
