A couple of weeks ago, I posted [photos of myself in a skirt](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEVirKNOO5t/) during a trip to Ikea in Regensburg on Instagram. Since then, I’ve been asked quite a bit about this trip, so I thought I would write a quick post about it. I don’t normally post about my everyday trips in skirts because that would be too much to write about and also not particularly interesting to read about.

What makes this particular trip unique is the fact that I actually took photos and posted them which is not something I typically do. For those of you who don’t have Instagram or haven’t seen the photos, I added them to the bottom of this post as well.

Frankly, there isn’t a lot to write about this trip either. My wife and I decided to go to Ikea and I wore the outfit I had put on in the morning: a dark-gray denim skirt, black thermal tights and a red and black checkered shirt. I added a black fleece jacket and my black peacoat when we went out.

Earlier in the day, I took a walk with my son wearing this outfit but with boots instead of sneakers. I also posted a couple of pictures from that [walk on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEUrKYtItZj/). You’ll find them below too. I opted for the sneakers for Ikea because they are more comfortable and we weren’t going to be out in the cold, wet weather.

I ran into people during the walk and there was no reaction whatsoever. They were entirely focused on my son. At Ikea, I obviously also encountered a lot of different people and no one cared. In fact, I ran into a younger man who was wearing a blue, pleated maxi-skirt. We looked at each other and in true “male” fashion, nodded in acknowledgement and went on our separate ways. That was it.

After Ikea, we went out to eat before going home. The restaurant was crowded, but again, there was absolutely no reaction to me wearing a skirt. My wife and I briefly chatted with a couple of women at the table next to ours, but it was entirely about our son.

So there really isn’t a whole lot to write about. It was uneventful with no reactions other than the brief nod from the other guy wearing a skirt. As I’ve said in other posts before, that is typical of my experience wearing skirts in public. Either no reactions or if so, then positive.

As a side note, I was out walking with my son just a couple of days ago in my [black skirt from Engelbert-Strauss](https://www.engelbert-strauss.de/kleider-roecke/rock-e-s-motion-ten-damen-3161420-66206-1200.html?itemorigin=SEARCH) when a young teenage girl approached me on the sidewalk and asked if I was wearing a skirt. I confirmed I was and her response was a simple: “I think that’s cool.” Then she left. That was the entire interaction.

So now that I feel liked I’ve dribbled on about nothing for long enough and since I can’t think of a better conclusion, I’m going to leave it at that for now. I hope you found it somewhat interesting and if you’d like to hear more about my everyday experiences in a skirt, let me know.
