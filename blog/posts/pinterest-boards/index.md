Over the past year or so, I have been pinning pictures of men in skirts, dresses and high heels to two different Pinterest boards. Since I often find it motivating and encouraging to see other men and how they dress themselves in a “feminine” way, I thought I would share them here.

You can find them below in this post, but also in the sidebars.

Do you know of any Pinterest boards or something similar that you would like to see featured here? Let me know in the comments below!
