It has been a few weeks since you’ve heard from me and that is because, as usual at this time of year, I’ve been spending a lot of time with extended family from the United States that I generally only get to see once a year. This time my parents are spending Christmas with us here in Germany.

I have been fortunate enough to enjoy wearing my skirts for the holidays both around my parents and out on our various day trips to scenic locations around the Bavaria. In fact, I even encountered another beskirted man at the Christmas market in Regensburg yesterday. He wore a glossy black, pleated maxi-skirt with white sneakers and white socks. It’s not exactly my style, but I was excited to see that another man felt comfortable to wear a skirt out in public.

Otherwise, I have been continuing to explore outfits and have even gotten a couple of new woolen skirts for the winter. I will post photos of them soon on Instagram.

I hope all of you have had a wonderful holiday season so far and I wish you all a happy New Year!
