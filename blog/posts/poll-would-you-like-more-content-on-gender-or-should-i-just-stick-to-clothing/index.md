Since men wearing skirts, heels, tights and other gender-non-conforming clothing is closely related to the topic of gender, I would like to know if you would like more content on gender as well as the usual program of skirt-related posts.

If so, what kind of content would you like to see? I have ideas of my own but would also like to hear about any thoughts you might have. If not, is there any other sort of content you would like to see on this blog aside from the usual skirt-related posts?

Let me know in the comments below!
