Several of you contacted me with a link to this article all the way back in January, so I knew I had to read it and post about it, but it’s only being published today because I had a long list of other links that were already scheduled to be published.

I certainly agree with all of the points he makes! Now I just wish that more men would actually wear them. While it’s great that there are more and more articles like this in mainstream media, they have yet to make a significant impact on how men dress.

The real change will come when mainstream retailers (both online and brick-and-mortar) start marketing skirts specifically to/for men. The “for men” label is more important to get over the psychological barrier of buying and wearing them than you would think. Just look at all the shampoos that use it!

So you’d never wear a skirt in public? Men, you don’t know what you’re missing | Phineas Harper

I started wearing them to test my sister’s lighthearted theory about feminism. Now I can’t do without their vibrant versatility, says Phineas Harper of Open City
