In a [recent post of mine](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/skirts-and-dresses/a-boy-in-a-dress-at-daycare/), a woman I talked to told me that she wishes more men would “grow a pair and skirt up”. That was a loose translation of the German she used, but it seems to have attracted a lot of attention with several of you commenting on it and liking the phrase.

That said, one person in the comments suggested I make a t-shirt out of it. So now my question: Is a well-designed t-shirt with that phrase on it something you would be interested in?
