Today’s “In the Media” post is a shout-out to another similarly-minded blogger who writes about the gender-neutral lifestyle. The blog describes itself as:

> Providing advice, opinions and inspiration for Hims and Thems who want to live a more gender-neutral lifestyle. If you’ve ever wondered why things were marketed as “for men” or “for women” when clearly they could be used by all genders, then you’re in the right place!

I highly recommend checking it out! There is even a specific section devoted to [Skirts for Men](https://postgenderific.blog/category/skirts-for-men/).
