With Christmas only a day ago in the United States and two days ago in Germany, it seems like the right time to ask about whether you got any skirts or other gender non-conforming clothes for Christmas.

If so, let us know in the comments below what you got!

After creating all of these Christmas polls, I realized that I have not taken into consideration the people that don’t celebrate Christmas. If you don’t celebrate Christmas, please let me know what you do celebrate, if anything, so that I can include you in my polls as well!

*There used to be a poll here, but had to be removed for this Markdown file because it relied on a WordPress plugin.*
