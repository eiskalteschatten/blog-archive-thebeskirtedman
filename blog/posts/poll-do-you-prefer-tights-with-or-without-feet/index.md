This poll is the result of a discussion I had with my wife about her preference for tights with feet. I actually prefer them without feet as I can generally re-wear them without having to wash them afterward. Tights with feet tend to stink after Iâ€™ve worn them once. This is a convenient way to distinguish between my tights and her tights in the laundry though.

I do prefer the aesthetic of a seamless transition between the legs and feet when wearing a low pair of shoes like sneakers, but I like the look of scrunched-up socks over boots which is what I tend to wear during the winter.
