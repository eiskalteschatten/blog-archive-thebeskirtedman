While this is a little outside of the scope of this blog with its emphasis on men wearing gender-non-conforming clothing, it is still an interesting read and several pointers could be taken from it even as someone who is not trying to mask their sex.

What I also found interesting about the article is that they discuss AMAB (assigned male at birth) people should feel free to wear clothing found in the women’s department — including skirts and dresses. They even have a few style recommendations.
