This skirted story is going to be a little bit shorter than the other ones because there isn’t a whole lot to tell. It all happened within less than a minute, but it amused me which is why I’ve decided to write about it anyway.

For those of you who have read my other skirted stories, you will notice a trend here. A few weeks ago, I took out the trash in a skirt and got yet [another reaction](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/skirted-stories/skirted-stories-young-teenager-girls-react/) while doing so. The trash cans are out by the curb so I am clearly visible to whomever happens to be walking by when I go out there.

This time, I took out the trash wearing my gray skirt from [Engelbert-Strauss](https://www.engelbert-strauss.de/en/womens-tabards-aprons/skirt-e-s-motion-ten-ladies-3161420-66216-1197.html). The skirt is rather subtle and unassuming, but it still got a reaction.

A young man, probably in his mid-to-late 20s, walked by and saw me in my skirt. His eyes visibly widened and he did a double-take. He never stopped walking and didn’t say anything, but he made it obvious that he was looking me up and down.

As he continued to walk, he looked back at me a second time, then he whipped out his phone and I assume probably sent someone a text message about it.

That’s all that happened. As I said, it was short and it amused me. I love pushing other people’s points of view and defying their expectations to the point that they have to do a double-take.

This is a great example of what a more casual encounter can be like. No harm done, no comments made, but there was a clear reaction.
