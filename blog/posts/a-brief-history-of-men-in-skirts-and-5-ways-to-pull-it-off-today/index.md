It seems like fashion publications consistently write articles about men in skirts and have for several years but that they don’t have much of an effect on mainstream fashion. Nonetheless, I think it’s important that they continue to do so because the more content there is about it, the more exposure!

In any case, this particular article is from 2022 and contains a little bit of history of men in skirts as well as some styling tips. Unfortunately, I find them to be too much like “runway fashion” for my taste but at least it’s there.
