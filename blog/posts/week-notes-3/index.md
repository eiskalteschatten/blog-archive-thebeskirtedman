Work, taking care of my son and the usual effort of maintaining a home kept me very busy this week. I didn’t get out much because there was too much to be done at home, but I did manage to finally make it to the gym for the first time in, well, about thirteen years. I usually exercise by playing drums since I play metal which typically has me sweating and requires a tremendous amount of physical effort to play, but at nearly 40, I’ve noticed I need more than just cardio, so off to the gym again it is.

Otherwise, my wife, son and I celebrated my 38th birthday which was on Tuesday. It was the first time that my son acknowledged someone’s birthday. While he still doesn’t quite understand the concept of a birthday yet, he has understood that it’s something you celebrate. Unsurprisingly, he enjoyed the cake more than any other aspect of it.

I spent the day beskirted in Regensburg. The only reaction I got was from another man who was wearing a utility kilt. It seems like I see at least one man in a skirt or kilt every time I go to Regensburg. My wife has had the same experience which makes me cautiously optimistic that men wearing skirts is becoming more popular here. As for the other man’s comment, he gave me a brief, yet sincere compliment, saying that we need more men willing to forego bifurcated garments in public.

And speaking of skirts, I was very happy with some of my outfits this week. Two of them are depicted below, but there was also a third outfit that I wanted to photograph but unfortunately, I didn’t find the time. It had a sort of Wild West/cowboy vibe to it. I’ll wear it again and hopefully get some photos of it the second time around.

As for this blog, I have two new profile submissions that I am going to prepare for publication soon. I hope to get to them today. I’ve been very neglectful and for that I apologize, but it has been difficult to find the time.

The weather has been very warm here the last couple of days, but is supposed to get much colder and rainy tomorrow. It would seem that this weekend was the last hurrah for summer this year. Accordingly, I will pull out some of my thicker skirts and tights, which I’ve found a renewed interest in after not wearing them much for a couple of years. Perhaps I’ll even pull out some of my colored tights rather than just always stick to black.
