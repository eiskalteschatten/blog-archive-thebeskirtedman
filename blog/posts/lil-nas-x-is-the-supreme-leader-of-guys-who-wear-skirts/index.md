I know some of you might be thinking, “Not another article about a male celebrity wearing skirts!”, but I’m posting it anyway because I think it’s still relevant. The more male celebrities that publically wear skirts, the more exposure we get and (hopefully) the more mainstream and accepted it will become for men to wear skirts.

A couple of sentences from the last paragraph particularly stuck with me: “It shows just how far menswear’s come. This stuff isn’t a novelty. Loads of guys are in on skirts.”
