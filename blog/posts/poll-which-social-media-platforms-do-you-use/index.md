Todayâ€™s poll asks about which social media platforms you use. I have accounts on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Beskirted-Man/100092703915429/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thebeskirtedman/) and [Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/TheBeskirtedMan), but it would interest me which other platforms you use.

If another one is popular enough, I might open an account there for The Beskirted Man as well. Also, let me know which platform is your favorite in the comments below!
