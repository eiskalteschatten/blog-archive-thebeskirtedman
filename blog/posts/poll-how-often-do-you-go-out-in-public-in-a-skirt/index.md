This week’s poll asks how often you go out in public in a skirt. Many men wear them, but many of them don’t wear them out in public.

If you don’t wear them out in public, what is preventing you from making the step? If you do wear them, what does it feel like for you to leave the house and be seen by people? Let us know in the comments below!
