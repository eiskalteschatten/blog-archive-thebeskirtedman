Today’s “In the Media” post is a double feature with two different articles reporting on the same topic.

School uniforms in the UK allow kids to wear trousers or skirts to school which means boys are expected to suffer through hot weather in long pants. Several schoolboys have started wearing skirts to school in protest.

Even though it is implied that only girls can wear skirts, the rules don’t specifically state that, therefore they are taking advantage of the loophole.

This is not the first year this has occurred. I remember reading about it every summer for at least two or three years now. The boys are protesting not being able to wear shorts, but they are certainly helping normalize boys (and by proxy men) in skirts.

Boys wear skirts to school in protest of no shorts rules during heatwave

Three boys said they wore skirts to school and felt more comfortable, after sweltering in trousers during the hot weather.

**Update:** The BBC just wrote another article about this topic on day this post was published:

Uniform policy states boys must wear trousers all year round – so Toby took a stance.
