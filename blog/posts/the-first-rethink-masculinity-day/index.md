This video just made me happy. A day organized by the Swiss organization, Die Feministen (The Feminists), called for men to come out in large numbers wearing skirts to work in Zurich, Switzerland. Several did come to the event on April 5, 2023 as can be seen in the video below.

Unfortunately, the video is in German, but YouTube allows you to turn on automatically translated English subtitles. It includes some information about the movement as well as interviews with some of the participants.
