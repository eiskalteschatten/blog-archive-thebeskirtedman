Todayâ€™s poll asks about the area you live in. This is an interesting question because some men may feel differently about going out in public in gender-non-conforming clothing based on their surroundings. Some may, for example, feel more hesitant to go out if they live in a conservative, rural community versus a more liberal big city.

It would also be interesting to hear about how where you live affects your confidence in going out in gender-non-conforming clothing. Let us know in the comments below!
