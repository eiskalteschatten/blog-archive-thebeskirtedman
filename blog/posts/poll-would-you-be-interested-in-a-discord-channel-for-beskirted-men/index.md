Today’s poll asks if you would be interested in a [Discord](https://discord.com/) channel for beskirted men. I have considered this idea before, but haven’t created one yet because of how many [other online communities](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/links/) for men in skirts already exist. I don’t know if there are any Discord channels, however.

Let me know what you think and what you would like to see from one if I were to create one in the comments below.

Edit: If you don’t know what [Discord](https://discord.com/) is, it is essentially a chat service. If there is interest, I could set up a server with multiple chatrooms where members could have a safe space to chat about gender nonconformity, skirts, their experiences, and other related topics.
