Today’s poll asks about whether you’ve ever worn a skirt around people and been disappointed that no one said anything about it. The experience I’ve had with wearing skirts around others is that it’s rare that anyone says anything unless they regularly see you in one or know you well.

There are times though that I do wear one in public or around people who haven’t seen me in one before and I would enjoy talking about it, but they don’t comment on it. I could bring it up myself, but I feel like that is counterproductive to making men in skirts normal. After all, no one would talk about a man in jeans.

So have you been in such a situation? Do you bring it up anyway? Or would you rather no one talk about it at all?
