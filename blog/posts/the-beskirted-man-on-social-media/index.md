The Beskirted Man is now on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheBeskirtedMan), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/people/The-Beskirted-Man/100092703915429/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thebeskirtedman/). I will use these platforms to share new posts as well as various other interesting tidbits of information I just so happen to come across throughout the day.

So if you donâ€™t want to subscribe by email, but are on one of these platforms and follow the blog, you will be informed whenever a new post is published.

I would very much so appreciate a visit on your platform(s) of choice, and, if you like *The Beskirted Man*, then feel free to like and/or follow the blog there as well! It would help me out tremendously!

Thank you!
