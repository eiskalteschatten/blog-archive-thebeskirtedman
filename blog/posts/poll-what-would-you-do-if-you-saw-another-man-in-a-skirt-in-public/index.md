Today’s poll is a little last-minute because I was walking around the old city center of Regensburg, Germany about an hour ago and saw an older gentleman out for a stroll in a skirt. He was wearing a shiny, ankle-length pleated skirt that was purple-ish in color with black tights and a long, black woolen coat with a flat cap. His hair was gray and he sported a neat, white beard.

I didn’t approach him, but now regret that I didn’t. That got me wondering what others would have done in my situation. Therefore, it’s time for a new poll that asks exactly that question. Let us know how you would have handled the situation!
