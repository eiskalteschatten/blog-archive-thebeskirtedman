Today, I’m happy to announce “[Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)” — a new series whose purpose it is to show the world that there are many different kinds of men out there who are interested in wearing not just skirts, but also dresses, tights, high heels and other gender non-conforming clothes.

But I need your help! If you are someone who wears gender non-conforming clothes and would like to help show the world just how many of us are out there, please consider participating. Also, if you know someone who might be interested, feel free to send them a link to this post as well!

How to Participate
------------------

There are two ways to participate:

-   Fill out the questionnaire on [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/kQfMkgAbkDCou4wx8)
-   Download the questionnaire as a [Word document](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Questionnaire-for-Profiles-of-Beskirted-Men-1.0.docx), fill it out, and submit it as indicated in the document

I will review and publish every response I receive. All questions are optional and any questions not answered will simply be omitted from the final post. If you would like to be notified about when your profile will be published, please indicate that on the questionnaire and I will let you know.

If you would like to submit a picture to be posted with your profile, please email it to alex \[at\] the-beskirted-man.com and indicate the name you give me in the form so that I know which profile it belongs to.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments below or by [contacting me directly](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/contact/). I will try to answer every one of them and update this post to include any missing information accordingly.

To get things started, I have filled out the questionnaire and posted it here: [Profiles of Beskirted Men: Alex](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/profiles-of-beskirted-men/profiles-of-beskirted-men-alex/).

I’m looking forward to hearing from you!
