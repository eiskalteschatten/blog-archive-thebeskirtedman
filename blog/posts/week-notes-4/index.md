So, I’ve finally gotten around to finishing last weeks’ Week Notes. My wife and I took a weekend vacation at a mountain resort in Austria without the kid which is why I didn’t get to it. It was very relaxing, except it made me realize how a little bit of breeze will go right through the thermal tights I have. I wore my [Engelbert-Strauss skirts](https://www.strauss.com/de/de/kleider-roecke/rock-e-s-motion-ten-damen-3161420-66216-1197.html?itemorigin=SEARCH) since they seemed most appropriate for the mountains and only regretted not having thicker tights. That said, we spent a lot of time in the hotel’s spa area which meant I mainly just wore swimming trunks.

I got a little adventurous with my outfits during the week trying out my knee-high boots with a black A-line skirt and black tights. I also pulled out my “transparent” fleece tights since it has gotten cold enough here and combined them with a blue and grey mini skirt and an oversized blue sweater. It was a very cozy outfit that I will have to remember to wear again (or at least some variation of it). The fleece tights are much warmer than the thermal tights and I should have brought them to the mountains with me instead.

Otherwise, there isn’t anything to report in terms of skirts and gender-non-conformance. I hope you all had a great week and that this one has gotten off to a great start!
