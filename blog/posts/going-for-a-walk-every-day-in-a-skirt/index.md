As the weather continues to get warmer here in Europe, I’ve been thinking about ways to get myself even more comfortable with wearing skirts in public. Warmer weather generally means being outdoors more often and this year, I’ve made a deal myself that I’m only going to wear skirts unless *I* really don’t feel like it.

One idea I had was to just go out and take a short walk every afternoon in whatever skirt I happen to be wearing. As a programmer, I’m often cramped up inside for most of the day working on my computer so it’s always nice to get out, get some movement, and feel the sunshine and breeze.

This idea would be beneficial for a couple of reasons. First, it would motivate me to get outside and exercise more than I have been. That’s, of course, always good for you. Secondly, it would give me a reason to leave the house in a skirt every day which I really do enjoy doing. It’s always a thrill even if it’s difficult to get over that initial hurdle of leaving my safe space at home — which is exactly what I want to work on and make easier.

By doing it every day at more or less the same time and conquering the hesitation by repetition and habit, I’m hoping to make it as easy as going out in jeans or shorts. Having a fixed time every day to get out and take a walk would help me tremendously in that regard.

Once the habit is established, I will be more likely to do it and by doing it repeatedly, I should get used to overcoming that ugly hurdle. That’s, at least, how it should work in theory. I’m certainly going to give it a real try and see how well it works. I’ll report back on it here at a later date.
