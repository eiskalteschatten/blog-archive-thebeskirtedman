Some of you who follow [Everybody Skirts](https://everybodyskirts.com/de/blogs/posts/major-dutch-brand-ad-shows-man-in-skirt) may have already seen this, but recently, a major Dutch brand showed a man deliberately trying on a skirt in this video advertising their clothing. The video is, of course, in Dutch, but you can turn on English subtitles for a translation. As Everybody Skirts points out:

> The Dutch voiceover during the scene roughly translates to: “Old classics, combined with new classics,” a nod to mixing styles without directly acknowledge the nonconforming fashion choice on screen.
