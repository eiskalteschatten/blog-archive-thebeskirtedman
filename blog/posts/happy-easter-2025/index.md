To all of you who celebrate Easter, I wish you a Happy Easter! Otherwise, I wish you a wonderful Sunday!

This year, my family and I are hosting an Easter celebration with my wife’s extended family which means we have a house full of guests all weekend. In Germany, Good Friday and Easter Monday are bank holidays, so we have an extended weekend full of family. It’s a bit chaotic, but it also means my two-year-old son is sleeping well through the night since all the stimulus exhausts him. Everything has its positives!

As far as wearing skirts goes, I am wearing them as usual. The only person who didn’t know about my beskirtedness is my brother-in-law’s wife, and while she was certainly a little surprised, she didn’t really care. So, not much to report there. I’ve worn them all weekend and will continue to do so. The weather is nice enough now that I can wear them without tights or leggings which is definitely my favorite way!

I hope all of you are doing well and having a good weekend!
