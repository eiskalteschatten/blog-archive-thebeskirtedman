It’s been a little while since you’ve heard from me here which just means I’ve been really busy with life offline. In any case though, I do have a small announcement to make.

I’m shaking up my social media presence a little bit in that I now have accounts on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@alexseifert) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/alex-seifert.bsky.social). These accounts aren’t just for The Beskirted Man though. Instead, they are general accounts I’ve created for me as a person. Any new post I publish on any of [my blogs](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/about/) (including this one) will automatically be posted to both accounts.

I am also going to more or less retire my [Twitter/X account](https://x.com/thebeskirtedman). I won’t delete it, but also won’t be updating it anymore. It hasn’t really picked up any traction with only the occasional response or like but primarily, I don’t want to support the whacko, chainsaw-wielding owner anymore.

In any case, here are the links to the new accounts. You will also find them in the sidebar and footer.

-   Mastodon: [https://mastodon.social/@](https://mastodon.social/@alexseifert)[alexseifert](https://mastodon.social/@alexseifert)

I hope to see you there!
