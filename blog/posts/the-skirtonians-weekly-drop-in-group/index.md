A little while ago, Chip over at [Everybody Skirts](https://everybodyskirts.com/) announced [a new weekly chat](https://everybodyskirts.com/blogs/posts/weekly-drop-in-group-underway) for people who are interested in the topic of men in skirts. I haven’t gotten around to announcing it here because [I have been sick](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/general/down-and-out/), but am now better and am starting to work on new posts again.

Here is what Chip wrote about it:

> A weekly video call to connect, face to face. Together, we’ll share insights, challenges, and strategies around owning your style. Guest speakers may join us, but most sharing will happen naturally—if and when you feel like it.
> 
> Let’s talk skirts, self-expression, and everything that comes with it.
> 
> -   **Who it’s for:** Men and anyone exploring style beyond traditional masculine norms
> -   **When:** Alternates weekly between Mondays and Wednesdays; drop-in anytime
> -   **How:** Online video call, no more than 1 hour, through Facebook’s Messenger app
> -   **Language:** English
> -   **Cost:** Free
> -   **Host:** Chip

Due to being sick, I unfortunately haven’t made it to the chat personally yet. I do plan on participating soon though! I’m looking forward to chatting with you soon!
