Today marks the first anniversary of the very [first post I wrote](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/general/what-is-the-beskirted-man/) for The Beskirted Man. It’s hard to believe how quickly a year passes.

Not only has a huge amount happened in my personal life, including becoming a father, but this blog has grown by leaps and bounds. I really can’t believe how much interest it has generated.

When I started it, I thought I would be writing about such a niche topic that just a few people would be interested in it. I never expected to be getting so many wonderful comments and interactions from other men from all over the world who share my interest in gender non-conforming clothes.

And for that, I am very grateful. I have enjoyed the journey immensely and am extremely excited to see where the next year takes us — not only with the website, but with the whole topic of men in skirts and other gender non-conforming clothes.

Let’s just keep on rockin’ those skirts and show the world that men can wear them and other gender non-conforming clothes too!
