Sonshine is an interesting, UK-based magazine that can best be described by the description on their homepage:

> Sonshine is a quarterly magazine taking a positive slant on parenting sons, to create a better world for all our children. Each issue follows a different theme and is packed with non-judgemental positive advice & articles, PLUS a healthy dose of down to earth humour.

While the magazine isn’t specifically about clothing, it does promote equality between genders. That includes topics such as boys being able to wear pink and show what are often considered to be “feminine” characteristics such as weakness or crying.
