It’s story time again, even if this is just going to be another short skirt story.

Last weekend, my wife and son were gone so I decided to take a trip to McDonald’s for dinner. I’m not a very good cook and I rarely eat fast food, so I figured I would treat myself to some junk food for once.

As usual, I was wearing a skirt and since it was cool and rainy, I wore black tights underneath it. It isn’t unusual for me to wear a skirt out anymore, but it is fairly unusual for me to get a reaction.

Once I got to McDonald’s, I got out of the car, walked into the restaurant and ordered my food using their digital, self-serve screens. By that point, I hadn’t noticed any real reactions. As usual, people looked at me, but not any differently than if I had been wearing pants.

As I was waiting for my order to come up, one of the younger employees walked past me and stopped when she looked down and saw I was wearing a skirt. She asked me if she could ask me a question (which is pretty amusing if you think about it), then when I confirmed she could, she asked me how I work up the confidence to go out in a skirt as a man.

She then proceeded to explain that her younger brother loves wearing skirts and is really into the whole “femboy” scene, but isn’t confident enough to go out in public even though he so badly wants to. My answer was, [as I’ve explained in previous posts](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/in-public/building-up-the-courage-to-go-out-in-public/), that the best way to do it for the first time is to go out with someone who supports you.

I suggested that she should take him out dressed in his skirt to help him build up the courage. She clearly liked the idea and said she would mention it to him, then thanked me about four or five different times.

After that interaction, I got my meal, ate in peace and returned home happy, full and satisfied. It was another small reaction that just confirmed to me that the vast majority of people either don’t care or are curious about your choice to wear a skirt out in public.

It also shows that there are a lot more men out there who would love to do it if it were more normalized. They just lack the confidence to go against the norm and embrace their unique style. That is why it is so important for those of us who have worked up the confidence to go out in public, to do it often and show others that it is perfectly fine.
