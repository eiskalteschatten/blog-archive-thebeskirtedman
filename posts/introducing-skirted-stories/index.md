Today I’m announcing a new category on the website called “[Skirted Stories](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/skirted-stories/)“. I intend to use it in order to share everyday anecdotes about my experiences wearing skirts both in private and in public.

They will be short in nature and probably not much more than a few lines each, but I will try to post them soon after they occur so that they are still fresh in my memory. That said, I will start with a few that have happened to me in the past to get it started.

The purpose of “Skirted Stories” is really to just show what everyday life is like for a beskirted man: the (non-)reactions, the (in)conveniences, the positive and negative feelings, etc. They are not going to be flashy, but they are going to be real.

Hopefully they will help people better understand what it is like or, if you yourself are a beskirted man, then maybe you can relate to some of the experiences. I’m looking forward to hearing what you guys have to say about them!
