This is a great post by a German man who regularly wears skirts, tights, heels and dresses and blogs about it. It’s about him working up the courage to wear a skirt and pumps to the office and what happened when he did.

The original post is in German (linked below), so I linked to it through Google Translate so you can read it in English. I haven’t read the automatically translated English, so I can’t say anything about the quality, so I hope it’s readable…

And so much for all those great, useless sayings that tell you to just do something… My experience is that whenever the word simply appears in a sentence, everything is true; it’s just never easy.
