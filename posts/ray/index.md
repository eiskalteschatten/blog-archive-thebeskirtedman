*Today, we welcome Ray from New York City to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Ray

**Where are you from?**

NYC

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts, hosiery, heels, dresses, bras

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

My entire life!

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I always favored beautiful clothing that always seemed to be women’s and men combined. Years ago I decided to start wearing the clothing I felt good in publicly and realized the freedom to be myself was more important to me than having someone else’s approval.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

I like how it looks and how it empowers me as a human being.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

I believe #clotheshavenogender. So I wear what I think is beautiful and makes me feel good about myself.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Every day!

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I wear my idea of clothing publicly every day. There is no place I won’t go dressed as I please.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I think we should all surround ourselves with people who support us and love us. It can be a dangerous world, but I have never let fear dictate who I am.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I love when men come up to me and tell me they love how I look and then tell me they want to dress like that. We can all be role models by living more authentically. I have never really had a bad experience except maybe when I get a bad run in my expensive hosiery!!!

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

No. I am fully public with who I am.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Absolutely

**What is your favorite style?**

Tight skirt, shiny hosiery, stilettos matched with a French cuff shirt vest and sport coat.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Online and at stores

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

Being authentically you is a freeing wonderful thing. We should all be able to be us.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**
