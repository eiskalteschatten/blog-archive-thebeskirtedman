Men’s skirts – Wikipedia

Outside Western cultures, men’s clothing commonly includes skirts and skirt-like garments; however, in the Americas and much of Europe, skirts are usually seen as feminine clothing and socially stigmatized for men and boys to wear, despite having done so for centuries.\[1\] While there are exceptions, most notably the cassock and the kilt, these are not really considered ‘skirts’ in the typical sense of fashion wear; rather they are worn as cultural and vocational garments. People have variously attempted to promote the fashionable wearing of skirts by men in Western culture and to do away with this gender distinction.
