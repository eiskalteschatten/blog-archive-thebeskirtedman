*Today, we welcome Greg from Iowa*, *USA to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Greg

**Where are you from?**

Iowa, USA

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Hosiery, skirts, dresses, and heels

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Off and on all of my life. I started wearing hosiery regularly around 5 or 6 years ago. I just started wearing skirts, dresses, and heels this year.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

It started when I was very young playing dress up with my sister at my grandparents. I’ve always really enjoyed the feeling of hosiery so I heald into that. The feel provides a sense of comfort and security. As for the rest of the clothing, I like the variety of materials and how they feel and how delicate they can be. I’ve never been a fan of heavy, thicker materials.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

Many people on Instagram have put it out there that you only live once. Although I don’t wear a lot of my feminine clothing openly yet, I hope to get there soon. I have a very supportive wife and kids who love me for who I am and that means everything!

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Freedom to express myself and wear the clothing that brings me joy.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

I wear hosiery almost every day. I wear a dress or skirt at home maybe 50% of the time.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I wear nude and suntan colored pantyhose openly all year long. Skirts and dresses are a new experience but I’ve noticed that they’ve increased my confidence in wearing hosiery whilst wearing guy clothes. I have to be mindful of how societies response will affect my family. I live in a fairly conservative area.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Yes but it gets easier all the time.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

My best experience thus far was probably the first time I wore pantyhose under my shorts going to the store. It was a feeling of accomplishment. My worst experience was early on in marriage when we were trying to figure out what it meant that I wanted to wear hosiery and other more feminine clothing.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

My wife and kids and one other family member know. No one else knows.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

A lot of my family because they are very conservative. Someday I’d like to be to a point that I just don’t care what others think.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Accepts and fully supports it.

**What is your favorite style?**

I really like vintage styles from the 30’s and 40’s.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Mostly from thrift shops but sometimes new from stores and online.

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

We have a lot of momentum moving forward as far as gender non-conforming lifestyles. I’m excited to continue to see progress.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**

My Instagram is [@nylons\_and\_riffs](https://www.instagram.com/nylons_and_riffs)
