While this particular article talks about Urban Outfitters adding a specific brand to their catalog, the real news for me here is that Urban Outfitters is now offering skirts and dresses in their “gender neutral” section. This includes some from other brands as well.

I’ve seen a number of retailers add “gender neutral” sections to their shops, but they only very rarely include skirts and dresses. For the most part, you can only find baggy clothes that I have no interest in whatsoever.
