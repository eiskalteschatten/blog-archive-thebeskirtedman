This is a very brief announcement to say that I’ve heard from some people I have emailed that my emails have been ending up in their spam/junk mail folder.

If you are expecting an email from me (for example, because you filled out a profile for [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/profiles-of-beskirted-men/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)) and are waiting for a response, please check to make sure it didn’t end up there.

The email will have come from alex \[at\] the-beskirted-man.com.

I apologize for that (especially if you were expecting an email and one never came) and have contacted my email host to see if we can fix the issue.
