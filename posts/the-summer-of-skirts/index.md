A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea that this summer should be the summer of skirts. The initial thought was that I would make it the summer that I, personally, finally get over the hurdle of wearing skirts outside and just start doing it on a regular basis without hesitation.

I figured the neighbors will get used to it eventually and after a short while, it won’t be a big deal anymore — if it ever actually was to begin with. After all, they’ve already seen me in kilts numerous times and after initial questions about why, just accepted it without any problem whatsoever even though I live in a small, conservative town in the country.

But then the question popped into my head one day: why should I keep this great idea all to myself and be the only one to do that? Why not publicize it and try to get as many people on board as possible?

****So, let’s make this the summer of skirts together!****

Everyone and anyone should feel free to participate, regardless of gender!

Male celebrities are already starting to publicly embrace it and it seems that every major celebrity event in the past couple of years has featured at least one beskirted man. So why not make it something the average man does as well?

And why stop at skirts? Men should wear dresses and heels as well! Go wild and crazy and make gender non-conforming fashion mainstream! The more men that participate, the easier it will get.

I will report on my progress and any occurrences that happen here on *The Beskirted Man* by creating a tag for my posts: [summer of skirts](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/tag/summer-of-skirts/).

I will also create Twitter, Facebook and Instagram hashtags that anyone who participates can use to report their progress: **#summerofskirts**. If you are active on other social media platforms, please use the hashtag as well! Let’s make this big!

There is nothing better in summer than the liberating feeling of wearing a breezy skirt on a hot day, so it’s the perfect time of year to really make a push towards men in skirts becoming a normalized aspect of society. And let’s have fun doing it together!

To help promote the event, I have created the graphic below. Feel free to download it and post it on as many platforms as possible to spread the word!
