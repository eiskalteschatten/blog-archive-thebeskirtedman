Today’s poll asks about how well dresses fit your body type. I have tried many different dresses, but it’s very rare I find one that fits my broad shoulders and long arms. That means they are either extremely tight around the shoulders and the arms are too short or they are too baggy and the entire shape of the dress is lost around my waist and hips.

This question is a little tricky to manage in a poll format, so if none of the answers fit below, feel free to give us more details in the comments below!
