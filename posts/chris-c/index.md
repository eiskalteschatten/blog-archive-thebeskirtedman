*Today, we welcome Chris C from the Southeastern US to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Chris C

**Where are you from?**

Southeastern US

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts and Leggings

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Leggings 15 years ago. Skirts in Public 2 years ago

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I started wearing leggings as a base layer when cold and for sports – running, work outs and yoga. They were so comfortable I started wearing them as casual wear to run errands, etc. Skirts actually morphed from wearing nightshirts for over 20 years. Why not have that comfort during the day.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

Comfort mainly but it’s also a bit of a thrill to break the norm and be a bit of a rebel. I wear skirts as a guy not looking to be confused as a women (nothing wrong with that if it’s your thing btw).

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Comfort, individuality, and a push back to the stupid notion of toxic masculinity.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

A couple of times a week in public. Around the house more often. I love my above the knee denim and khaki skirts during the summer

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I do but am somewhat selective of where and who I might run into. Not so much for me, but respect of my wife and family who are not 100% cool with it and don’t want to have to explain why I do it

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

For me personally, it has become easy and a year of being more mindful in doing it. I’m not over the top with it so I’ve had no negative issues. Most people don’t even notice.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Best experience was flying to the west coast and back skirted. Being in an airport with so many people and “nowhere to hide” was so much fun and exciting

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Immediate family yes. Friends no.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

Yes, extended family

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

She does to a point. Leggings, no problem. Skirts, she’s open-minded but not thrilled about it

**What is your favorite style?**

Simple, basic skirts that can be worn in more masculine way. Mostly knee length or his above the knee. I wear t-shirts, polos, untucked button-downs and pullover with running shoes or boots mainly

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Thrift stores are the only way to go! Cheap with a great selection!

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

Thanks for taking the time to produce this site and content. Very cool that your spouse is supportive and contributes. Her insights are key for me and I share them with my wife. Also key to the men in skirts discussion in general to understand a woman’s POV
