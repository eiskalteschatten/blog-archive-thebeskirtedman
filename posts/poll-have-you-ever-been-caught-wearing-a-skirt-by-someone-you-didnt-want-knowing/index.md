Today’s poll asks about a rather sensitive subject for some men. Being caught wearing a skirt (or any other gender non-conforming clothing) by someone you don’t want knowing can be a tremendously awkward and embarrassing situation.

If you have been caught, what happened? Did it lead to any problems or was it actually a good thing in the end? If you haven’t been caught, what would you do if you were? If you don’t have anyone you don’t want knowing, was there a time when you did? Let us know in the comments below!
