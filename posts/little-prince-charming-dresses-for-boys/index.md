[Little Prince Charming](https://www.littleprincecharming.com/) is a small online shop based in The Netherlands that sells dresses for boys. According to [their mission](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17938044778613978/), the idea behind the shop is to “make this world a better place for children \[…\] by making it a little (or hopefully a lot) more normal and acceptable for boys to wear dresses.”

The shop isn’t very old, so they don’t have a huge selection, but they certain do have a few options that I can imagine would appeal to many young boys. It is definitely something I will be keeping an eye on for my own son as he grows up if he develops an interest in wearing dresses.
