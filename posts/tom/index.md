*Today, we welcome Tom from the Houston, Texas area to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Tom

**Where are you from?**

Houston, Texas area

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts and compression hosiery.

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Compression hosiery since 2012. Skirts since May 2022.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

Started with the compression hosiery in 2012 to help with my circulation due to vascular disease in both legs. Began wearing skirts in 2022 as a way to take pressure off my left inner thigh and relieve nerve pain from a previous vascular surgery.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

Started as medical. The comfort I feel wearing the hosiery and skirts has reached a point that I prefer wearing them even if I no longer would need them for medical reasons.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

It is just clothing and I do not feel it should matter to anyone but myself as to what I now choose to wear. The comfort I have gained from what I now wear has made dealing with vascular disease in my legs a bit easier. As a truck driver of over 31 years, what I wear today makes sitting for many hours at a time more comfortable. I wish I knew skirts would be this comfortable much sooner.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Every day.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes. I wear compression hosiery and different skirts and a pair of Skechers slip on shoes everywhere I go.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

No. The only person who has ever made an issue of what I wear has been my ex wife. She is just narrow minded in her beliefs of what a man should wear, though I never question her wearing of more male oriented pants and such. I travel between Houston and Albuquerque, NM every week in my tractor trailer. I go through some very conservative areas. Not a single issue raised by anyone at any truck stop I go in! A few smiles from women, but not a single negative interaction with anybody!

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

No bad experiences other than it disgusting my ex wife early on. My best experience would have to be the first time I got out of my truck and went in the truck stop wearing a knee length denim skirt. Initially I would change into shorts, but this time I said to myself it is time I face this fear! It was a non event! This lead to me opening wearing a skirt and hosiery everywhere in public, including at truck stops! I own the look and confidently walk around like everything is normal!

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes. I fear judgement from nobody! If someone doesn’t like it, so what! It’s my life and comfort that matters to me only!

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

No. Anyone who doesn’t know just hasn’t seen me since I started wearing skirts nearly two years ago.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Only my ex wife has ever made an issue of it. She has been wanting to reconcile with me. I made it clear that how I dress, especially since it helps with a medical condition, is not debatable. Accept me as I am or not at all!

**What is your favorite style?**

Knee length denim from the start. I do have a few favorites from Skirtcraft. For the last few months I have been wearing a few different color hiking skirts from a company called Lightheart Gear. Very comfortable and has some really awesome big pockets on the skirt. A snap button in the middle can make the skirt also sort of look like you are wearing shorts.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Online

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

Don’t fear judgement from others! Wear what makes you feel comfortable and happy! Just act the same way you would if wearing pants and you will see no one cares! I go in and out of multiple truck stops in TEXAS and no one cares! The fear is mostly in one’s own mind!
