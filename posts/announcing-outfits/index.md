“[Outfits](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/outfits/)” is a new, ongoing series of posts I am going to write that is, as the title would imply, all about gender-non-conforming outfits. The idea is to post pictures and details of my favorite outfits that I think look great and what I like about them.

I’m going to post outfits that I’ve put together myself as well as any I happen to find online that I really like. Of course, I will try to get permission to use the latter if they aren’t from a major publication or something like that.

Anyone who follows me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thebeskirtedman/) will have seen some of the outfits I’m going to post, but I post so many that my favorites quickly get lost in the flood. I also don’t write about why I like them on social media, so I’m going to do that here instead.

I’m looking forward to seeing what you have to say about my favorites and whether you agree with me or not!
