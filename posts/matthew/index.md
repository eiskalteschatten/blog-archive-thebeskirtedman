*Today, we welcome Matthew who is originally from the UK, but now lives in New Zealand to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Matthew

**Where are you from?**

Originally the UK, but have lived in New Zealand since I was 17

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Anything and everything.

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

Always been jealous of the colours and styles available, but have experimented for around 25 years

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I found my wardrobe boring and frustrating ‚Äì wearing clothes was a chore, so when I decided to branch out fully, I first discussed it with my wife and children, got their blessing and support and then just dove in, went on a shopping spree in my wife‚Äôs skirt and a tshirt.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

It‚Äôs fun, I like how I look, people seem much nicer and I enjoy the compliments. It‚Äôs good to make people question their world view occasionally üôÇ

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Personal expression, freedom

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

All the time, when applicable. Even to the gym, I have a nice skort for that. Typically hunting, chainsawing etc means trousers

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn‚Äôt go?**

All the time, everyday. Gym, town, children‚Äôs schools‚Ä¶ Anywhere I would wear trousers, I would wear a skirt.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

No, I‚Äôve had so many nice interactions, there is no fear

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Walking across a big road in a city, two women in their 20‚Äôs come up and tell how great I looked‚Ä¶as I have basically never got compliments like that when wearing ‚Äúnormal‚Äù clothes, it really touched me.

Worst experience, haven‚Äôt really had any that are worth writing about

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes, however my parents have not spoken or seen me since, and some of my extended family back in the UK do not seem to be supportive or understanding.

**Are there people you don‚Äôt want to know about it?**

My elderly grandfather, he may or may not understand, but I won‚Äôt see him again due to being in the UK, and it isn‚Äôt worth the risk to bring it up.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Totally, she was the one who gave me the nudge to embrace it fully.

**What is your favorite style?**

Flowy colourful, loud and cheerful.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Op shops & high street shops‚Ä¶no shame in trying stuff on in the mainstream women‚Äôs stores.

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

Been a great experience, a real eye opener and has renewed my hope for society. I expected children to be the worst, but they don‚Äôt care (teenage girls can be a bit giggly in a spiteful way), but who cares.

My farming community have been great too‚Ä¶ Everyone I expected negative reactions from, I didn‚Äôt get‚Ä¶
