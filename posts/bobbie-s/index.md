*Today, we welcome Bobbie S from England to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Bobbie S

**Where are you from?**

England

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Tights, stockings, skirts and dresses.

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

When I was about 7 when I wore my first pair of tights for a school play.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

The compulsion to wear the clothing I love became overwhelming and I simply gave in and started wearing tights and skirts in private and very discretely under male attire in public.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

I have found this difficult in the past but as I have got older it has become much clearer. It is a compulsion to wear those items I love because it transforms how I feel about myself, my inner peace and happiness.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

I think they look and feel amazing, are very comfortable and their effect upon me means they are a release to my personal expression and comfort to my well being. I am sure I am a better person when I am dressed.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Weekly although I do wear ladies briefs everyday as they are quite simply far superior in comfort and practicality. If I’m not wearing a skirt I do try and wear tights under my trousers for work.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Occasionally. This is a real issue for me. I would like to wear skirts and tights everyday in public but my wife is not supportive. So I go out when I can without her knowing. I hate doing this but it’s that compulsion to be myself. If I do get out it will be to a shop, cafe or just to get fuel somewhere. I try not to go to places where I might get caught out.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Actually I don’t. It tends to be a little nerve wracking at first but that soon dissipates when you realise the majority of people could not care less.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Every experience has been great. Some of my choices may have been unwise on occasions but I’ve not had a bad experience per se.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

No, only my wife.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

Parents, they are too old to cope now.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

No. She is completely conditioned to assume I’m either gay or mad. She knows but simply doesn’t accept that it’s ok to wear in public. We are working on it but progress is painfully slow.

**What is your favorite style?**

Simple denim skirt, opaque tights, shirt, fleece and boots or trainers.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Online and some stores who all seem to be ok with it. I have a particular liking for Snag tights and have found Oasis to be very good

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I’m really struggling with this, the conflict with my wife, at the moment and grateful for any advice people may be able to give me. I do not want to lose her.
