*Today, we welcome Matthias from Germany to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Matthias

**Where are you from?**

Germany, Hessen

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts, dresses, tights, pantyhoses

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

About 15 years ago

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I started with tights as a replacement for long johns. I always wore leggings when I played sports. A little later I tried it with the first skirt.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

First of all: I was tempted to try out clothing that was “forbidden” for men. Second: the variety of fabrics, cuts, colors, patterns. Thirdly: that I simply found these clothes nicer than the uniform clothes for men. Fourth: Skirts are simply more comfortable than pants.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Men are oppressed by the way they dress. In general (except for sports and leisure) they are not allowed to show their legs and must hide their arms and neck.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Every day

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes, I wear skirts, dresses, tights in public.

There are places I avoid, but it has nothing to do with clothing.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

It depends on the mood. Sometimes I don’t dare to wear a colorful patterned dress outside. Instead I put on a less flashy denim skirt.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

The best experience is that all the big fears I had before were unfounded, so I was able to increase my self-confidence over the years.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Yes

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

Close-minded minds

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Totally. She supports me.

**What is your favorite style?**

I definitely want to remain recognizable as a man. I wear skirts and dresses to showcase that men in general can also wear skirts and dresses.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Mostly online because the selection is simply better. In the store only if I really like something straight away.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**
