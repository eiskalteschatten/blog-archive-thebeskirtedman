For the past couple of days, I have been working on updating and optimizing the website. It had gotten a little slow and I wasn’t entirely happy with the homepage, so I decided to sit down and work on it a little bit.

I first redesigned the [homepage](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/) to include more posts in a more informative layout. It also includes a list of the latest comments.

Most of the changes happened behind the scenes though and will only be noticeable by the website being faster (I hope). I won’t go into too much technical detail here, but I tweaked a bunch of cache settings and removed a few things that had to be loaded by the browser. The most visible of which is the font. The website now uses your system’s standard font rather than a custom one so that it doesn’t have to download and process an extra font file.

Otherwise, I tweaked a little bit of the code to make it more accessible and also to optimize it for Google.

Overall, nothing too exciting, but hopefully it will make the website more pleasant to use and reduce loading times.

*If you have any feedback on the homepage or loading speeds, I’m always happy to hear it! Let me know in the comments below!*
