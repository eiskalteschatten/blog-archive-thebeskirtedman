While hosiery is only really mentioned in passing on this blog, most men who wear skirts seem to also wear hosiery with them. They really do go hand-in-hand.

This video is an interesting talk about the stigma with men wearing hosiery. Many of the points brought up could also easily be applied to other typically ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù clothing such as skirts and heels.

The video is by Soni Panda who also did an [interview with Markus Muth](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/in-the-media/interview-with-markus-muth/). I highly recommend checking both videos out!
