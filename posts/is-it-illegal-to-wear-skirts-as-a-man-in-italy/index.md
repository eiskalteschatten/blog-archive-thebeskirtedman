*Update: Based on all the evidence that has been pointed out to me as well as my own research looking into Italy’s actual penal code, I would have to say that wearing skirts as a man is **not** illegal in Italy. Read on to see why this question came up to begin with.*

A few days ago, I came across a thread on one of the “men in skirts” forums I frequent that discussed whether it is illegal to wear skirts as a man in Italy. There were no solid conclusions which made me curious, so I did some research of my own and this is what I found.

At first glance, it seems that it *is* illegal to wear a skirt as a man in Italy. There is apparently a law on the books that makes it illegal to wear any “clothes of the opposite sex”:

> The Italian law on cross-dressing is contained in Article 582 of the Italian Penal Code, which states that anyone who “in a public place or open to the public, appears dressed in clothes of the opposite sex, or otherwise disguised in a way that is likely to disturb the public order, shall be punished with arrest for up to six months or a fine of up to € 516.”

So apparently the Italian legal system considers being dressed “in clothes of the opposite sex” to be a disturbance to the public order and given that Italy’s current government is very right-wing, I think it’s highly unlikely that anything about it is going to change anytime soon.

That being said, however, the only references to this law I could find were those listed below. Among them, only the first one mentioned the actual article number that supposedly forbids beskirted men.

I tried to find it in a Google-translated version of Italy’s actual Penal Code but was unable to find anything about it. [Article 582](https://www.altalex.com/documents/news/2014/10/28/dei-delitti-contro-la-persona) was about causing personal injury and didn’t mention anything about disturbing the public or about dressing in “clothes of the opposite sex”.

And that means I am back to square one: I still don’t really know if it’s illegal to wear a skirt as a man in Italy or if it’s just a rumor. I would love to be able to answer the question definitively, but from what I can find online, I can’t unfortunately.

My advice would be to just proceed with caution if you do visit Italy and would like to wear a skirt as a man. Perhaps asking an Italian policeman before venturing out in a skirt would be the best, most cautious approach.

*What are your thoughts on this topic? Have you seen or heard anything about it? Have you ever worn a skirt as a man in Italy? How do you think it applies to “men’s skirts” such as kilts? Let me know in the comments below!*
