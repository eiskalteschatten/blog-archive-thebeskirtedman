This is just a short post to announce that I will not be extremely active on this blog or social media until after the holidays. I have been traveling internationally for the past week and will be spending a lot of time with family I don’t see often.

If you have commented on a post either on this blog or social media recently, I apologize for not getting back to you all that quickly. I haven’t forgotten, I’ve just been traveling!

There are a few “[In the Media](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/in-the-media/)” and “[Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)” posts I have prepared that will still be published, but I won’t be able to get to any other articles until after the holidays.

I wish all of you a happy holiday season and I am looking forward to writing about a lot of the ideas once I am back home!
