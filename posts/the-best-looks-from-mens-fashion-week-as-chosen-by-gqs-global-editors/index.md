This is a post of various images from Men’s Fashion Week for fall-winter 2023. It’s a little dated now that it’s summer 2024, but as usual, I am pleased to see that there are a number of men wearing skirts. It’s a little tedious to scroll through to find them if that’s all you’re looking for, but it’s always refreshing to see them.
