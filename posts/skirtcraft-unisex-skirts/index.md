Skirtcraft is a small company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota that makes unisex skirts with large pockets. It was founded by a man who discovered his love for wearing skirts as best explained from the [About page](https://skirtcraft.com/about/):

> A while ago, I wanted to start wearing skirts.
> 
> I’d realized they were cool, and that I hadn’t considered them before because I’d thought of them as being just for women (I’m a man). But it occurred to me that they really weren’t—except by convention, and even then, only in certain parts of the world. I was missing out on one of the most basic forms of human clothing for no good reason!

I couldn’t agree with him more! I am not sponsored by him, but I find his concept so wonderful, that I think it deserves its own post, so definitely check out his work.

You can find his products on his [website](https://www.skirtcraft.com/), but you can also find him on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/skirtcraft/), [Tumblr](https://skirtcraft.tumblr.com/), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.cloud/@skirtcraft) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Skirtcraft).
