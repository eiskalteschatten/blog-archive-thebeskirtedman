I am currently doing research for an article that is near and dear to me as a programmer and gender-non-conformist, but I need input from others who also work in the tech industry.

It is no secret that a lot of programmers and other people who work in a computer science-related field are often gender-non-conforming or trans. I have even [worked with some](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/skirts-and-dresses/a-femboy-at-work/). Some consider themselves to be femboys while others just simply enjoy breaking gender clichés. One such example is [“programming stocks”](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/programming-socks) which have become so prevalent that even Linus Torvalds, the creator and lead developer of Linux, has them:

So this is where I need your help.

If you are someone or you know someone who works in a computer science-related field and enjoys wearing gender-non-conforming clothes or is trans/questioning their gender, I would like to know a few things:

-   How and why did you start?
-   How often do you do it?
-   What do you like to wear?
-   Does anyone know about it amongst your friends and family?
-   Does anyone know about it at work?
-   Have you worked with anyone else who is also gender-non-conforming or trans?
-   Why do you think gender-non-conformity and the topic of gender is so prevalent in the computer sciences?
-   Anything else you’d like to add

Of course, any answers can be as long or short as you’d like and you don’t have to answer all the questions. Also, feel free to add anything else you think is important or relevant. That would help me out a lot!

I won’t publish any answers directly but rather use them as research for the article(s) I’m working on related to this topic. I may quote one or the other answer, but I will ask for permission beforehand.

If you’d like to help out, you can get a hold of me by commenting on this post, sending an email to alex (at) the-beskirted-man.com, or via the [contact page](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/contact/). You can also send this page to as many people as you know who might be able or willing to help out.

I would really appreciate it and I’m looking forward to any responses I receive!
