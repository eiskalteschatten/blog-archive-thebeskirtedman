This is the first of several “skirted stories” that I will write. Some will be about experiences that have occurred in the past and others about experiences that have recently happened.

So, let’s get to it.

About a week ago, I took out the trash wearing one of my simple, a-line, solid color skirts with black tights. This normally wouldn’t be a noteworthy event since I regularly go out of the house for small chores, but this time a couple of young teenage girls walked past and reacted to my attire.

Our trashcans are in a very small shed right next to the sidewalk and street, so when the girls passed, I was very close to them and they could see me well. I have been seen wearing my skirts by passers-by fairly frequently, but normally no one reacts. These girls were different.

One of them stopped, looked at me, pointed at me and said loudly to her friend (who by then had stopped as well): “He’s wearing a skirt! How awesome is that?!?”.

I looked up from emptying the trash into the trashcan and replied, “There are a lot more men that wear skirts than you think!”. I didn’t have time to think of something smarter to say, but I figured it was good enough.

The girl then just said, “That’s awesome!”, and they went on their way.

It was a very brief encounter, but it always feels good to hear that people like what you are doing, especially when it deviates from the norm.

*So now I would like to hear your feedback. What do you think about this “short skirted story” format? Would you like to read more of these kinds of encounters even if they are small? Have you ever had any sort of encounter like mine with the two girls? Let us know in the comments below!*
