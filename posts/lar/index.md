**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

over 40 years ago.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

It started at a school fancy dress party. It just felt so liberating & comforting to wear a girls skirt, feeling the soft material & the breeze!

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

I enjoy the wide variety of materials, textures, colours & styles. Its an expression of my identity.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

Its about creating my own style & listening to my soul & not restricting myself to other people’s ideas of style & fashion. It makes my heart sing & brings me joy.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Most days

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes in leggings, blouses, modern style kilts, heeled & tall boots every couple of weeks general shopping, socialising Skirts only on occasion so far. I wouldn’t go to certain areas of my local town & the city at night for general safety reasons.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

not so much now apart from Skirts & hosiery which are a challenge, but I plan to wear my skirts & hosiery more this year.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

My best experience was last year when I visited Prague & another part of the Czech Republic.I spent 2 days in the city wearing 2 different styles of skirts, sandals & painted toe nails, stayed in a small central hotel with no comments or looks.

The highlight was the small festival/retreat about an hour south of Prague. I wore mostly just above the knee skater, satin & velvet skirts satin blouses. I received many compliments about my skirts & tops & my choice of bronze toenail varnish. There were 2 more guys in skirts there.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Some close family & friends know but I think it’s time to spread my truth to more of them & be true to myself.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

Some business/legal advisers

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

She has reluctantly accepted me wearing what I like at home but is not comfortable going out with me in a skirt yet. She is ok accompanying me wearing ladies heeled or tall boots & leggings.

**What is your favorite style?**

I like just above the knee or long skirts, colourful leggings, silk & satin shirts & blouses, cuban or heeled boots with hosiery & skirts or leggings & heeled/tall boots. I love ladies silk scarves so wear them as a cravat or with a round neck jumper. I love textures & soft materials.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

I have bought most of my skirts, blouses & leggings in store & 1 dress which I tried on in store. If I see something appealing in a shop I’ll usually buy it there & then in 2 sizes so I can fit at home & bring the wrong size back. My kilts & my Daves brand skirts were online as were my boots. Some luxury hosiery online & good value ones in store.

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

The main thing is do what makes you feel good & don’t wait too long to experience the empowerment of nurturing your soul. It’s usually never as daunting as you think it is.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**
