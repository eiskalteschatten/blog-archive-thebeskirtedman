*Today, we welcome Mateusz from Poland to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Mateusz

**Where are you from?**

Poland

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

I enjoy wearing skirts and tights, and very occassionally dresses (as nightgowns)

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

I started wearing such clothes beginning of this year (“privately” AKA at home) and finally went first time outside in a skirt in August.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

Well, I had to cleanup my mother’s wardrobe after she passed away and I decided to try some clothes, not only to see if any are still “usable” but also to know “how it feels”. Turned out to be as normal as “normal men clothes” so I decided to somehow integrate it into my attire although it took some time and over-thinking about it.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

Hmmm, I think I just want to have a bit of fun in this short period we are in this world. I’ve heard already several times that I’m not “manly enough”, too skinny, too shy, too long hair and few more adjectives that can be used to make such statement – prior to wearing skirts. Therefore, since I’m not able to be “manly” anyway, it won’t hurt my masculinity to wear skirts and tights.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

I do not put any specific meaning to such clothes, maybe just a “message” to my family and to the world – hey, I’m the same guy in skirt and the same guy in trousers.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Almost every day with exception of Sundays

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

Yes, now I do, basically every day giving my dog a walk few times, going to a grocery store, to post office, in a bus or while riding a scooter. I do not go in “gender non-conforming clothes” to church (probably never gonna try) and to football (soccer) games (as my dad asked me to “dress normally” so that his friends will not ask questions about me being “gay”).

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Right now not, maybe it’s a little bit tricky when I pick clothes for the first time (kinda afraid that it’s not fitting and someone will point it out), but once I do “christening” of such outfit, I feel safe and comfortable after two or three days. Sometimes I go with my younger brother and he feels uncomfortable when I wear skirt but I try to show him that I do nothing wrong, so if people stare at me, it is still completely fine, because we never walk with closed eyes.

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I did not encounter any best/worst experience, as I did not receive any feedback. Possibly considering it the “best experience” actually since people maybe just consider it as normal? Or at least not worth bothering guy to ask about it.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

“Closest” family knows about it, friends know about it as well.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

I’m not sure, I meet rarely with further members of my family and they might be shocked about it, but I hope it wouldn’t be a problem if they see me in a skirt. Can’t predict the “verdict” though so I’m not sure if I’m going to show them this look.

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

I don’t have partner so I don’t have to worry about it.

**What is your favorite style?**

I prefer “monochrome” colours of the outfit, as I own few black/gray longsleeves and black/gray skirts, alongside black tights. I do not feel confident in picking colors together although I obviously have some green and blue garments. In autumn/winter I try to use thick tights and similarly thick pencil midi skirts or long plaid skirts to keep it all warm. In summer I adopt over-the-knee socks together with mini skirts and whatever on top to give kinda girly, maybe a bit femboy look.

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Mostly online, as I feel I would spent too much time in shopping malls to find something I’ll suddenly decide that I need to buy. With online shops/stores it seems to be easier as I try to always “prepare” what I’m looking for.

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I recommend every male (age doesn’t matter) to simply try it out: to wear skirt, especially in the summertime. Probably it will not “get into it” everyone and for good, but at least you’ll know how it is, and whether it really is that different from trousers to be considered as “not for men”.

**Do you have any links you would like to share (i.e. social media profiles or websites)?**

No, not really, but I think it’s worth checking the [“Menskirts” community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menskirts/) just to get a glimpse of clothes men wear, maybe to leave a comment or just get some feedback if you’re questioning your outfit and prefer to get some advice you might find difficult to get in “reality”.
