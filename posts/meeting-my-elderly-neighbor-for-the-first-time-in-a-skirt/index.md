This is one of those mundane experiences that wouldn’t normally be noteworthy if I hadn’t been wearing a skirt when it happened. Since it just happened about half an hour before I’m writing this, I thought I would make a quick post about it.

Today, March 20th, is one of the first nicer days of the year here in southern Germany. The weather is very mild and it feels a lot like spring. That means, of course, that a lot of people are out doing yard work for the first time this year.

Since my mother is currently visiting, she volunteered to mow our backyard. Of course, I couldn’t say no to that sort of offer, so I went out and helped her get the lawnmower set up. I went out in the skirt I was wearing which was my green “work” skirt from Engelbert-Strauss (see the picture below).

There is a small apartment building next door to us with six condos in it. An elderly man lives in one of the ground floor condos which all have a small yard. I had never met him before, but my wife had.

As I was helping my mother with the lawnmower, he approached the fence and started chatting with me. I walked over confidently and we chatted perfectly normally over the fence for about twenty minutes.

Never once did the skirt I was wearing play a role in anything whatsoever. He didn’t mention it, didn’t stare at it, didn’t even look at it even though I’m absolutely certain he must have seen me in it even before we started chatting. In fact, I’m certain he’s seen me in it several times before because I’m not ashamed to go out in my own yard in a skirt. Our conversation, however, was the entirely normal, mundane banter of two neighbors meeting for the first time.

I’m telling this story because I think the more normal social interactions we have as skirt-wearing men, the more normalized men wearing skirts will become. It also shows just how wearing skirts as a man plays little to no role in everyday interactions, even out in public.

He had probably never seen a man in a skirt before he met me (or saw me for the first time) and yet, he couldn’t have cared less about it. Of course, I wasn’t wearing a floral, flowy, “feminine” skirt, but even if I had been, he probably would have reacted the same way he did with my “masculine” green skirt.

Wearing skirts in public and around others as men is easy once you get started. [Most people don’t care](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/personal-experiences/most-people-dont-care/) and even those that do are generally going to be very positive about it. It’s definitely worth a try.
