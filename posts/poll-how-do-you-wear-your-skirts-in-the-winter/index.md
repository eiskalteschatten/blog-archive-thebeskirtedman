Since wintertime is upon us here in the Northern Hemisphere, this week’s poll asks how you wear your skirts during winter. I have heard many different ways of wearing skirts and staying warm during the cold weather, so let’s hear how you do it.

In this poll, you can choose more than one answer since most of you probably use multiple methods to stay warm.
