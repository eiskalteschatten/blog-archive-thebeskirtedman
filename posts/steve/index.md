*Today, we welcome Steve from Australia to [Profiles of Beskirted Men](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/category/profiles-of-beskirted-men/)!*

**What is your name?**

Steve

**Where are you from?**

Central coast of nsw Australia

**Which types of gender non-conforming clothing do you enjoy wearing?**

Skirts, dresses, nighties, heels, hosiery and lingerie

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

I guess it really started with hosiery in the 90’s

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

Hosiery was worn as an alternative to long johns for winter warmth but I had always had a flair for sexy underwear and it all spiralled from there

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

I love the comfort of skirts and dresses. I love how my legs look and feel in hosiery and the colour and comfort of lingerie. Menswear is unbelievably boring in shape comfort, materials and colour. If you were working on a production line, you could not find more boring clothes aside from the suit.

**What do gender non-conforming clothes mean to you?**

It’s a way of escaping the mundane menswear life and giving conservatives the middle finger. It means comfort and individual styling men don’t have.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

Anytime I’m not at work but even then, lingerie is against my skin.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I will give the envelope a bit more of a push. I went out recently wearing a kilt with fishnets and my wonderful supportive wife was disgusted at the comments from the men in the restaurant. Thankfully I didn’t hear it. I think it’s a find the right audience as conservative types still don’t welcome individuals.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I do. Because of small minds, the kind of clothes you wear in public can attract unwelcome come comments

**What is your best and/or worst experience in gender non-conforming clothes?**

I think the last outing with the kilt and fishnets. I felt comfortable and happy. The worst was being outed for wearing hosiery by a loudmouth travel mate many years ago.. Women are the worst.

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

Only my wife and a few close friends who also wear

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

I think it’s always the case. I have a dill next door who is a right wing conservative and I feel he would make a big deal

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Yes she does

**What is your favorite style?**

I think skirts with beautiful hosiery

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

In some stores and online

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

Mens clothing is so dull and joyless it stuns me that men continue to wear it just to ensure they maintain the Fascade of being manly. I hope one day the fashion industry and the retail sector would understand the gold mine waiting for them if only they understood the hidden market.
