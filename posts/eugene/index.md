Skirts, dresses, leggings, tights/pantyhose, tank tops/cami, panties (all kinds) knee socks, jumpers, shorts…..

**When did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing?**

I started wearing panties at an early age. I started wearing skirts and camisole’s when I was in my teens.

**How did you start wearing gender non-conforming clothing and why?**

I grew up with older female siblings and cousins and it looked good on them and I wanted to look good also.

**What is your motivation now for putting on gender non-conforming clothing?**

To feel better about myself. It’s about the only time I feel comfortable.

**How often do you wear gender non-conforming clothing?**

When I’m home mostly. I do wear leggings in the winter under my pants at work because it keeps me warm and also no one can see them. I also wear panties every day.

**Do you go out in public dressed in gender non-conforming clothes? If not, why not? If so, how often and where do you go? Are there any places you wouldn’t go?**

I’ve only worn “women’s” shorts out in public a few times because I wouldn’t be noticed as much. Where I live it wouldn’t be a good idea to wear anything else in public because I live in the south.

**Do you find it hard to go out in public in gender non-conforming clothes?**

Yes!!

**Do your family or friends know about how you dress?**

My wife knows and she supports me and knows that I want to be out in public and can’t. She also likes to buy me things to wear around the house. I also have a daughter that knows.

**Are there people you don’t want to know about it?**

Yes

**Does your partner accept your clothing choices?**

Yes

**What is your favorite style?**

Skirt/dress with hose and a tank top

**Where do you shop for your clothes?**

Mostly online or thrift stores

**Is there anything else you would like to add?**

I wish that I could be more able to go out in public and not be gawked at for wearing what makes me feel comfortable in.
